how is it different from the original fluxx? is it worth getting if i have the first version?,descriptive,"The only difference is a few extra cards, it's just the newest version of the original. If you were thinking about getting a new fluxx game i would suggest getting one of the specialty games like pirate fluxx or Monty Python fluxx. That way you could play them separately or mix the decks together.",NA,"[3, 3]",1
how is it different from the original fluxx? is it worth getting if i have the first version?,descriptive,"This is pretty similar to the original, however this version does have the extra ""space/star"" theme which comes in a handful of cards. I would say as someone else pointed out, some of the keepers, such as war and taxes, are now called Creepers and can prevent you from winning the game unless there is a rule card in play that allows the creeper to be used towards winning the goal. There are a few other cards such as a ""Double Agenda"" card that changes  up the way you play. Overall, if you have the original Fluxx, I would recommend getting any of the themed specialty ones that really tends to creative new dynamics to the game. The Star Trek themed fluxx is a good one that involves character play and even special ""powers."" And as always,  you can mix the original fluxx with any of the other versions for double the fun, though it might get extraordinarily confusing.",NA,"[3, 3]",1
how is it different from the original fluxx? is it worth getting if i have the first version?,descriptive,"Not really worth it if you have the original.  As I recall, it has a few different/new cards.We lost our original deck, so had to get the new one!",NA,"[2, 2]",1
how is it different from the original fluxx? is it worth getting if i have the first version?,descriptive,"I have only played the original version once. However, I did notice a couple changes. First of all, in 4.0 there is a ""rules escalation"" card, so that every time the deck has to be shuffled during one game then the basic rules ""draw one, play one"" increase by one. For example, if the deck has to be shuffled once, then the rules escalation changes the basic rules from""draw one, play one"" to ""draw two, play two"". If the deck has to be shuffled a second time during three same game then the basic rules escalate to ""draw three, play three"" and so on. Also in 4.0, some of the keepers, such as war and taxes, are now called Creepers and can prevent you from winning the game unless there is a silver lining rule card in play, or the creeper is part of a goal card. I don't know of any other differences as I only played the one game and didn't get through the whole deck, but some other things in 4.0 that could possibly be different are as follows:There is a ""radioactive potato"" that is passed around the table everyone the goal changes when it is in play. If you have the potato card in possession you can't win. However there is also a rule card that can be played that says you must have the potato card to win when you have the keepers that match the goal. There is a ""double agenda"" card that allows two possible goals to be available at the same time. There is an inflation card and a party bonus card that both increase the number on the cards, similar to the basic rules escalation mentioned above, but they increase any of the rule cards with a number on them, not just the basic rules. Lastly, there is a ""first play random"" card that requires the player to your left to choose your first play, unless you only have one play at the time according to the rules.As I said, I don't know how much of this is really different, but I hope I helped you decide if it is worth it. A someone else posted, there are always the specialty versions like the Monty Python version (you really need to know your Monty Python skits and songs to do well), martian, pirate, etc...Have fun no matter what you decide.",NA,"[2, 2]",1
Is mixing a bunch if the different themed decks together a good idea or does it become too complicated?,descriptive,"That's not really necessary. Each themed set is the entire game of fluxx, with a twist. If you are going to play or have played the original fluxx, that is the concept of the game. Each themed deck is the same game, so to speak, but with different rules, goals, keepers and creepers that fit with that theme. The Looney Labs crew may have a different take on this, and I haven't read their FAQ recently on this topic, but just thinking about the game(s) I wouldn't mix them up. Once you've played 2 different versions of fluxx you'll know exactly what I'm talking about, and how the concept of the game...""how it works"" is the same framework, but each game has a flavor of it's own!It also seems like there's something for everyone within all of the expansions. There are still a few I haven't played, but look forward to!",NA,"[1, 2]",0
Is this a good game for adults,descriptive,"We didn't care for it at all. Found it to be very confusing, and we had a 15 year old, a 40 year old and a 60+ year old trying to figure it out. Maybe you'll have better luck with it.",NA,"[1, 3]",0
how young can a player be for this game,descriptive,"I would get Family Flux to teach them how to play.  My kids have played since they were 8 and I know they could have played a bit earlier.  Family Flux does not have the ""creepers"" so it is easier to play.  Family Flux also has family cards - parents get a bonus if the card is played.  That kind of thing.  It's a blast!",NA,"[3, 3]",1

what is the range that this truck can go before it doesn't get a signal?,descriptive,"It hasn't been used since last fall. I contacted my grandson who told me it still charges up (after 2 years of massive abuse) but the battery runs down in no time. He claims he has had it run as far as 'Kevs house' which is probably 5 city lots down the street. So I would estimate at 40 foot per lot, then 200 feet would be about right. I'm amazed that the thing still exists, given his ability to destroy anything not made of 1/4"" steel plate. It'll probably need batteries this spring or a complete rebuild. Maybe his father could reach into his pocket and cover that? hope that helps.",NA,"[0, 1]",0

Is this good for 7 or 8 year old?,descriptive,"Thats a tough one IMO, its made of light plastic so it's safe in that aspect but the blades do spin quite fast. Would really only be a problem if it were to hit one of his eyes. It does take some practice and patience to fly correctly. With out trying to sound rude, it's possible the child may either break the item in a short period of time or lose patience trying to get to fly right. It really depends on the child and thier capabilities at that particular age. I hope this helped!",NA,"[4, 4]",1
Is this good for 7 or 8 year old?,descriptive,It depends on their skill level...it would be tough to fly if they have never flown a heli before...if it is their first time I would start with something like the Syma S107.,NA,"[4, 4]",1
"This will be my first RC Helicopter, so I will sound dumb here. Do all V911 batteries fit in the H911 I just purchased?

how to play the game mouse trap,descriptive,"the instructions are in the box.  You roll the dice, move your piece around the board.  Almost every time you land you build a part of the mouse trap.

how to play the game mouse trap,descriptive,"This is played like a traditional board game, where you roll the dice and advance your player.  You get pulled forward or pushed back based on where you land.  To add to this, you are constructing a complex mouse trap on top of the board at the same time, one piece at a time.  When conditions are right, you are able to run a round weight through the trap and possibly catch an opponent to make them lose the game.  It's a fun game for everyone.",NA,"[2, 2]",1

It's in the sun about half the day and that might help how it's worn.  But kids and dogs have climbed on the lid (I try to keep them off) and no cracks yet.

At almost 5, he has absolutely no problem with the height and 6 and 7 year old's play with it too with no problem.  Obviously it can last to age 6-7 and beyond so the age question answered itself.  It has a nice lid, hard to fasten so I just place it on top.  He loves the little ramps for his cars and we leave construction vehicles (Matchbox size) in there and he loves that.  Water is fun for one side but it creates slimy algae mess so I rarely fill it up or if I do, I empty it every day.  Expect sand to be all over your patio or wherever you place it, which is slightly hazardous as we didn't realize how slippery it can be.  All in all, a great investment!",NA,"[2, 3]",0

"Could a near-4-year-old use this? Hi --have a girl, around 38-40 lbs, who used what I believe was this model in a hotel pool, loved it -- am wondering if, despite the product's message that it is for up to 3 yrs. of age, it could be used for an older kid.All best,EM",descriptive,"I would not recommend this for a child that age. I mange an indoor pool and this is a great product that we get a lot of use out of, but children older (larger) that a two-year old are big enough and strong enough to easily tip this toy over.

For safe pool play, I would recommend the Supersoft Life Jacket from Texas recreation (fun, comfortable, and safe) and of course constant adult supervision. =) Swimways also makes a regular kid or adult sized Spring Float that would be safer when paired with a lifejacket.

(<<However, this is misleading, because the balcony being where it is reduces the opening to 2"" tall.)Side towers (entrance from courtyard): 3 1/4 tall x 1 3/4 wide.the back tower is narrowest at 2 1/4"" tall x only 1 1/4"" wide.And the trap door runs about 1 1/2"" x 2"".We have a handful of figurines the kids use to play with. The Disney princesses with big ballskirts (roughly 3""x2"", like Tiana and Belle) get stuck easily in the smaller openings or going through the trapdoor. The slimmer ones (like Mulan) fit through most openings. The Toob knights (roughly 2""x1"", army man size) fit nearly everywhere. I hope that helps!",NA,"[3, 3]",1

"Should I get the set of 30 or the set of 15, I'm a beginner artist and I am just starting out?",descriptive,"IF you plan to continue your art and you can afford it (it is a good price), I'd suggest the greater variety of colors.   For me wider choices engaged me to experiment with how to use, learn more, and enjoy the craft.   Lay down your color with the pencils and watch what happens when next you use a brush,  (the best are the ones with a water resevoir in the 'handle'). Experiment. You can put a wash over all the colors and watch what happens.   Colors keep their integrity too.   You can reapply color for another layer over the wash.  You can start or end with permanent ink too.   So many possibilities.   So why limit the color choices?  The medium is non-toxic and relatively non-messy. A small jar of water.  A few paper towels, the pens, your water color paper, the brush and you've a portable new pastime.  You can take it anywhere, it travels well,  or stay on your sofa. If you decide it's not for you, give it to a young artist,  it'll make someone else's day.",NA,"[2, 2]",1

We talk of it frequently.The device does more than slow the speed of revolution of the CD! That is why I bought it! It replaced an earlier device which slowed or sped up the speed of revolution of the CD, thereby affecting the pitch. This device is different.

"Electronic ""Learning System"" that does not require computer I am attempting to purchase some sort of electronic ""learning system"" toys for kindergarten children from underprivileged homes.  Is there a system currently offerred which does not require a computer for the set-up or usage?  Most of these families would not have access to a computer.  (Apparently, the Leappads are no longer manufacturered and the My First Leappads seem designed for younger children.)",descriptive,"The Tag system only requires a computer for the original set up.  If you load the readers with whichever books the child chooses before they take them home, they can still use five books or activities at a time (and you probably wouldn't want to send more than 5 home with a single child at one time).  It would be fairly easy (and quick) for you to load readers for them.  You could even put together Tag packs where a certain reader always stays with a specific set of books, so you never have to reload the readers once you do the initial setup.  There would be no need for anyone to have a computer to use the Tag system if you've already set it up before it leaves the classroom.  Then, the kids still get the benefit of the Tag reading system without their parents needing any technical skills or computer access (and the Tag reader is at least a little fun for adults, so they might enjoy it too).  If you do send these home with kids, I would get some kind of protective case for the pen (whether it is the Leapfrog one or something else) to contain it all and keep the pen from being damaged.  I have both:  Tag and Leap Pad.  Here is what I think:Advantages of Tag:No cartridges (can't get lost and don't need to be switched)Books are sturdier (spiral bound Leap Pad books have a tendency to have pages rip out)You don't need to press a green go button every time you turn the pageBooks are currently being produced--library may expandCurrent technology (tech support, replacements available)No bulky system to carry along with the booksFewer batteries requiredWill tell the stories by pressing the play button, even without the book being present (as long as the book has been used since the Tag was loaded)- Other accessories available:  National Geographic flashcards (which I really like although I wonder how well they will stay together over time), Super Speller, and Funny Phrases (both are bulky and hard to remove the tiles--I have some concerns about durability of these boards)Disadvantages of Tag:- Only holds 5 books or activities at a time (unless you go with the orange Tags which cost more--check http://store.leapfrogschoolhouse.com/SchoolHouse/Store/BestSellers/PRD_TSRK/Tag+School+Reading+System.jsp for info on those)- Fewer titles have been produced (there are lots of Leap Pad books out there... if you can find them)- More expensive (Leap Pads can be found in lots on ebay for less money than Tag systems)- The reader may become damaged if mistreated or not properly transportedIf you want to get Leap Pads, you could try posting on your local freecycle group (check yahoo groups to see if one exists in your area) or see if your local paper will allow you to post a free wanted ad.  People there may have Leap Pad books or games they are willing to donate to a school.  Garage sales are another great source of Leap Pads and books--I have about 12 books I paid about $1 each for at garage sales and several readers.  You could also do a combination of Leap Pads and Tags to keep variety and reduce the expenses as well as provide the broadest expsosure.  Good luck with your project!",NA,"[1, 2]",0

Do you think it would be good for an 11 year old girl? Or is she too old?,descriptive,I am 26 and spent over an hour with it when I gifted it to my nephew... I also have a degree in biology and have spent plenty of time with my eyes glued to very costly microscopes. It's a great toy. An 11 year old would have no problem using this and could easily find objects to observe closely. Even without slides it is awesome!  She is definitely not too old to appreciate this microscope.,NA,"[4, 4]",1
Do you think it would be good for an 11 year old girl? Or is she too old?,descriptive,I would get something a little more complex.  This is really just a glorified magnifying glass.

Could prepared specimen slides be used with this scope?,descriptive,"Not really. This is more of a stationary magnifying glass. I use it to look at garden bugs up close, leaves, rocks, etc. You can view 3-dimensional objects with this, unlike a true microscope where you look at ""2-dimensional"" objects.

Can I brush this product on?  I am trying to repair the chipped faux chrome bezel on my Glaxay Note 3.,descriptive,"It can be brushed on, but prepare for a lot of work. Be sure it's mixed thoroughly before each coat. You want to work with very light coats, basically the thickness of the particles in the paint. After each light coat, let it dry, and then gently buff it with a clean, tight fiber cloth. This will flatten the particles, knocking off some that are not 'aligned'. After a few coats, the mirror effect will improve greatly.These paints are formulated for airbrush to ensure a very even, thin coating. Think of this paint as a liquid of very tiny mirrors - if you use a brush, you need to work hard to make sure all of them lay flat and even.",NA,"[2, 2]",1

Do the lights come on when not in use?,descriptive,"As this is the yo-yo I did most of my learning with, I had to experiment a lot in terms of how to throw it and all that.  After two months of hitting walls and the floor on accident and throwing it too hard with improper technique (which once ended up in a 75ft high yo-yo meteor almost hitting someones windshield) it required a hit or two on the side to stop the lights if they had stayed on.

This doll is not large, preemie size, about 14 inches long with his legs bent a bit at the knees, so would be similar to an 1800 gram weight real baby.

"my 81/2 yr old daughter is starting a music program, taking guitar. She is left handed, will this work?",yesno,"Kaye is correct, but there are two considerations: 1) You'll have to remove the nut and reverse it along with the strings (so that the heaviest string is at the top) 2) You don't really have to add a pick guard with a classical guitar, but it doesn't hurt. They're available all over but will add slightly to cost of guitar. Converting this to a lefthand guitar would involve removing the strings, taking off the nut, put on a new nut (which can be tricky), reverse the bridge saddle (easier to do), and purchase a pick guard at a local store (if you want one) and add it to the guitar (but that's not really essential).   Then put the strings back on in left-hand order so the heavy E is still at the top when held left-hand.  Something better to consider:  a lot of left-handers can play right-hand just fine.  It's just a matter of training oneself.  Since on the guitar both hands are equally busy, imho it honestly doesn't matter which hand does what (unless of course, one has already learned left handed guitar).  Think piano-- left/right handed doesn't really matter.  They don't make ""left handed"" pianos (at least, not that I'm aware of).  I have always believed the whole ""left handed guitar"" thing is kind of just a way to sell specialized ""more expensive"" guitars.  If one is just starting out, it's just as easy to learn right-handed guitar method, and far more beneficial in choice of guitars. ; )",NA,"[2, 2]",1
"my 81/2 yr old daughter is starting a music program, taking guitar. She is left handed, will this work?",yesno,"Probably not, it is set up for a right-hander.

whats the best way to tune this guitar?  and do the cords match a standard guitar?  I am having a hard time playing the notes I know on this one.,descriptive,"Ah good, I caught this one early.  For me the best way to tune a guitar-- if you have a good ear-- is with a tuning pipe and by ear.  Others need a tuning device and there are many good ones out there (I've found the combo capo/tuner to be excellent).  For your second question:  yes, the chords match a standard guitar.   If you use the right strings you can even get it to tune to E rather than the typical A of most half-size guitars.  I suggest Martin normal tension or high tension nylon strings (depending on the sound you wish).   Also, tune the string slowly to prevent warping and breaking-- and realize that with any nylon string or guitar it will take daily tuning, twice a day for about a week for the tuning to set in... or playing it for a couple hours the first day and constantly tuning it.   Nylon strings take time to ""stretch in"".  Where a lot of folks make a mistake is expecting it to ""hold a tune"" first day.  That's not how nylon strings work, ever.   If you find the tuning keys ""slipping"", use a screwdriver and tighten them.  Should tune fine. : )",NA,"[3, 3]",1

What is the age group for this game?,descriptive,"We've been playing this with our almost-5-year-old and he loves it. My husband is a HUGE strategy board game fan, so it runs in the family, and we've been playing simpler games with him for a while.

is it realish?,yesno,"I'm not sure what you mean by realish, but it won't cause any nightmares for young kids. The ""bad guys"" are drawings on thick paper tokens that lay flat on the game board. No blood, no gore. It's as ""real"" as the players imagine it to be. Our family likes to role play a bit--so when we use the card with the archer on it, we pose as though we are shooting a bow at the orc token laying on the board. But that's by our choice. The ""bad guys"" are drawings on tokens. The ""good guys"" are drawings on cards to be used by the players. The stronger bad guys have more hit points, so require more hits to defeat. There are a few hero-types that can deliver more damage than the typical defender. The add-on (sold separately) adds magic to the game. Hope this helps.",NA,"[2, 2]",1
How well does this game work for one player?,descriptive,"Never tried it with just one, but I'd bet it would work; you might have to adjust the number of cards you get per hand until you get to a point where you feel it is ""balanced"" (probably one more card per hand than two-person game)",NA,"[0, 1]",0

"Could I take the globe apart and make the magnet inside levitate something else (say, a back to the future hoverboard model ...)",descriptive,If you are an engineer you could attempt it with confidence. Should not be too hard if you get the geometry right but then you could just make your own. The object centre of gravity must be kept below the magnetic centre of lift and their vertical axes must coincide. The sweet spot is very small so this is going to take effort. This design is optimised for a round object. For a hoverboard I would try something else. You at least need to mount a model person on the board to raise the magnetic lift point.

Getting the globe positioned perfectly for levitation is difficult at first but with just a little patience I got mine balanced and it's been running flawlessly ever since.

Adobe Air was installed and the Spy Net Field Office client software on my Windows Box, but try as I might, even though it indicated the watch was 'connected' and I had 'activated' a mission, nothing worked on the watch.  I tried resetting the watch, wiping it out, reloading the defaults, all to no avail!  However, I figured out how to MANUALLY copy over a mission as follows and now it works!  First off, after selecting the mission in question from the Spy Net client window, I then went to the following folder in Windows Explorer:  C:\Users\<Your username here>\AppData\Roaming\com.jakks.spynet (To see the AppData folder, it is hidden by default in Windows, so be sure to select 'Organize' --> 'Folder and search options', then the 'View' tab that comes up, and select 'Show Hidden files' down below, then Apply it.)    Within the  com.jakks.spynet  folder, go down even further into the  \Local Store\en\images\missions  folder.   Here you will see all the mission videos that can be individually copied to the watch.    You will also notice in the  com.jakks.spynet\Local Store\en\HQ\Data folder that there is a Missions file and an ActiveMission file.  I didn't actually mess around with these because I noticed that when inserting the Spy Net Watch into my computer and it popped up with a new letter drive (for me, the letter G:\ drive),  I opened file G:\System\data.ini with notepad or wordpad and saw that the info about the mission I had chosen was there!   It contained the mission video name and the mission text within it... so why was it not working on the watch I groaned and questioned??!!   Well, I copied the mission video it indicated to use for the mission I chose into the G:\Videos  folder (for example,  B014_C013_0613VQ_H-Spynet128x128.avi  is the first 'Reconnaissance' mission I believe)  and then I tried the watch again... still no luck.   Then I though perhaps the Spy Net software folks might've screwed up and I moved/copied the G:\System\data.ini file over to the top level of the G:\ drive   (G:\data.ini) because that's where I saw a file  'config.ini' also existed and figured perhaps it belonged there as well... and then tried unplugging the watch to try again and... hurray!!!... there was the MISSION!  Finally!  I have no idea if my son's watch is the only one in the universe with this problem, but at least now I know how to manually set him up and make him happy to run his missions...",NA,"[1, 4]",0

why will it not fly,descriptive,"You will have t be more specific as to what your problem is, possibilities is it is too windy, when I had this plane it would handle some wind but, being as small as it is (it's only meant to be a toy) it can only handle so much. Also check to ensure the propellers are on the right way, best way to do this is give it some throttle and if it blows wind backwards then they are on right.

I added the batteries and reluctantly handed it over. The head snapped off within an hour.  My son went to bed in tears, still clinging to the two pieces.

It never sucked up one speck of dust as far as I could tell but that didn't bother me too much, as the boys didn't know it should have done that. We had both hardwood and carpet and the vacuums were used mostly on the hardwood. They were both broken (the foot broke off from the body - no fixing that!) after about 5 months. They did enjoy them while they lasted though! They begged to get them out of the vacuum cleaner closet every single day. They were pretty unhappy when they broke and then disappeared.",NA,"[4, 4]",1

If so, I noticed the same thing on mine.  However, it was on a day when the water was not smooth but a bit choppy.Remember in the instructions it stated propellers will not run unless in water??  Well part of the electrical connection system is a wire to each of the propeller axles (inside the boat); when both propellers are in the water there is a connection; if one or the other comes out of the water - connect ion is broken!!  The propeller(s) bouncing in and out of the water would cause this.

Reading your history of other Helis, I believe that you want to progress on this hobby, so: buy the mSRX (BNF no TX), 2 or 3 lipos, and buy a good radio TX ie DX6i, because this heli with stock TX is difficult to control.

doe's it run on fuel?,descriptive,"This model is an electric. Small Lipo battery is included along with a 12 volt DC charger. Although fairly easy to fly, it is not a trainer aircraft. Flies fast and needs to be landed under power. This aircraft is 5 channels and the flaps need to be set properly or the will ""nose-up"" upon flap deployment. That means a computer radio compatible with the Spectrum receiver inside the model is best to mix the elevator and flap channels to alleviate the extra lift provided by flap deployment.

How long does this thing run on an average hot cup of water (not boiling)?,descriptive,"This is a Gem. My husband ran it over and over again from Christmas day on.  It developed a squeak so he lubricated the 4 moving points on the wheel and the small rod that comes out of bottom. He used a very small amount of Lock-Ease because it has a graphite base with a petroleum distillate that evaporates, leaving a long-wearing film of graphite. We heated 9 ozs. of water in a coffee cup to 195 deg. in a room temp of about 70 deg. The Little Sterling Engine ran for 72 minutes 47.55 seconds. Ending water temp. is about 105 degrees.

Has worked perfectly for a year now.  It sounds like a complicated process, but is really very simple.  Forget your warranty, they don't honor nada.

"does this product comes with charger, lipos and transmitter?",yesno,"Adrian, The 'BNF' version of this plane does not come with a transmitter, charger or lipo. Bind n Fly remote control planes typically just come with the plane and the receiver hooked up inside. So it's your responsibility to throw in a charged lipo and bind the receiver to your transmitter and then get the plane in the air.  Most micro RC planes like the Sbach come either as a BNF version or a RTF version (Ready to Fly). The RTF version will have everything you need: plane with the receiver, lipo battery, charger and transmitter. Personally I would recommend buying a good transmitter that can bind several planes, and buy a universal charger that can handle most lipos and then buy the specific batteries you need for each plane you buy. Then you'll be able to buy every plane as the BNF version and save yourself A LOT of money. Of course, this will only work if you plane on getting several planes over time. Otherwise getting the RTF version of a plane or 2 is the way to go.To complete the setup for this Sbach plane you will need to buy:- 4+ channel DSM2® or DSMX® transmitter- 2S 7.4V 180mAh Li-Po battery- 2S Li-Po balancing chargerFor the record, this is a very fun plane to fly. But if you are just getting into the hobby I would consider something a little slower in the air and a little less.....acrobatic. This Sbach is not super easy to fly. You can do a ton of tricks and acrobatics and the plane is crazy-responsive to your controls. But keeping this plane in 1 piece requires fast reflexes and lots of practice. The best plane I've found to fly with little or no experience is the Parkzone T-28 Trojan (the micro version, not the full big size one). You can find the BNF version of the T-28 Trojan here on Amazon. Unfortunately I don't think the RTF version is available anywhere currently. I'm not sure why. Good Luck!",NA,"[2, 2]",1

Why does the person in the picture have their hands inside the sides of the Ostrich mask? Is that for plugging your ears with your fingers?,descriptive,"Well Lucy, while I can't be certain what the individual in the photo is doing, I would think they are resting their head, keeping their hands warm, or doing something that isn't appropriate in polite society.  Besides, as everyone knows, if you commit a crime it is quite common to be caught via hand identification (this is second only to facial ID), so this person may have committed some infraction in that library.  As for why one might opt to put their hands in there, my guess would be because it would be very challenging to manuever your feet into the holes while wearing it on your head.",NA,"[3, 3]",1

How do you get the batwing to work?  That is the only piece that didn't work and I think it has something to do with the 2 red pieces strapped to Robin and Batman but can't figure out how to assemble them so the batwing will flip over.  Help?!  Or is mine just broken and need to be taken back?,descriptive,"Not sure if this question still begs answering but the answer is two fold:The red pieces that came with Batman/Robin were simply to keep them attached to the set while in the packaging.  Those pieces have nothing to do with anything regarding the cave.  I had the same concern when we opened up our Batcave, but figured out it was just a anti-theft device.The Batwing/Batwing holder.  Located on the top right side, the Batwing/Batglider actually detaches from the yellow, tall holder.  Its a little scary pulling it off the glider, but if you look it has two holders that will go around the waist of Batman or Robin.  As for the rotating the Batwing/glider its kinda tricky.  What you do is rotate the yellow holder with Batwing to the right, it will rotated to be upside down.  If you continue and push in you will hear a ""click"".  Now the batwing is upside down and ""locked.""  You can now take Batman/Robin/your fingers and rotated the red platform(turning to the left), you will free the Batwing and it will ""pop"" back up to(as seen in the photo).  You have to put a little pressure while rotating to cause the batwing to swing back into place.",NA,"[2, 2]",1

(I bought all three minions plus Gru).  It doesn't even seem like easy to make a scratch on it.  Overall, my opinion, it's well built and good quality.

"is it necessary additional battery to have more power life ? If yes, please inform battery specification / model.",yesno,"The battery provided with the Stampede lasts 30 minutes or so if the truck is driven on a paved surface. If used "" off road"", the battery life is noticeably less. If a higher capacity battery is desired, the Racer's Edge  NiMH 5000 mAh , 8.4 volt hump pack with TRX plug gives a very long runtime. Keep in mind that the longer the truck runs on a charge, the hotter the various electrical components can get without a cool down period. All other thing being the equal, speed comes from battery voltage, runtime comes from the mAh rating of the battery. MAh is milliamp/hour, power over time.

Can you tell me what the overall size is? Are you happy with the product.,descriptive,"Hi, This is a copter that I have flown for some time now.  Many variations of these quad copters have come out, and it is amazing what they have been able to deliver for such low prices.  I ordered a couple more for some friends of mine based on how great a copter the x4 is.  It is important to get the H107L model if you want it to include the colored LED's.  These, in my opinion, are crucial for determining orientation while flying this copter.  I have built many quadcopters of varying sizes over the last couple years, and I can say that this is as close to these higher end homebuilt models than any in it's price range.  The controls are quite accurate, and I can confidently say this copter is a great entry into learning to fly these types of aircraft.  The controls are just like those of high end RC copters of just about any type, which means one learns the right way from the get go.  I have some friends that have bought other copters that move some of the controls to the opposite sticks from the standard, and now that they want to upgrade, they have to relearn to fly with the different stick orientation.  Fair warning, the X4 is very sensitive to inputs, so in turn it is not as inherently stable as some entry level copters.  Don't let that discourage you from getting this copter however, it can be learned, and it is VERY good when it comes to crashes.  Just make sure no blades are overly damaged (A.K.A. split down the middle, bent, broken, etc.) set on level ground, power up slowly to make sure nothing looks/sounds strange, and you are flying in seconds after a crash.  If a blade is damaged (this is the most common major damage resulting from crashes) they are easy to replace (remember there are A and B blades of each color, so make sure you are replacing damaged ones with the right pitch direction) you can pop them off with your fingers, and then just press another on.  After all that, to answer your questions, the copter is just over 4"" across (not including blades) and about an inch and a half high.  I am very happy with the product.  I have had mine for months, and It still amazes me that they can make something that works this well for such a low price.  It certainly has it's set of issues that could be improved upon, but I don't think they could do any more for such a low price tag.",NA,"[2, 2]",1

Is this game different enough from Resistance to merit buying both?,descriptive,"YES. This is a completely different game than ""The Resistance"" though the genre or style is the same. Both are bluffing games and feature the same style of art and design. Each has its own mechanics, however, that do not overlap. The Resistance is a team-based game that unfolds over several rounds. Coup is a one-round individual game. The ""roles"" in The Resistance consist of team ""Good"" and ""Bad"" basically, but in Coup each player is assigned two out of five roles that each has its own set of actions, counteractions, and inherent weaknesses. Another important thing for play with my younger family members, as we discovered: it is entirely possible to win Coup without lying!",NA,"[7, 7]",1
Is this game different enough from Resistance to merit buying both?,descriptive,Yes.   Game varies quite considerably from resistance.  The bluffing/lying aspect is what the games have in common.  I have both and pay both.  This game plays better in smaller groups when you don't have enough for resistance.,NA,"[3, 3]",1
Is this game different enough from Resistance to merit buying both?,descriptive,"Yes it is. There is a much different mechanic from Resistance in that you are only fighting for yourself. No team business. Also, if you're going to buy Normal Resistance, instead, buy Avalon. Wayyyyyy better IMO.",NA,"[2, 2]",1
Is this fun to play with only two players?,descriptive,"Yes. The double roles allow bluffing to work well even with two players. It's also easiest to get a handle on the deeper strategies of the game when playing with 2 players because you only have to focus on one person's bluffs. It's similar to how Love Letter's strategy starts feeling more simple but focused with 2 players.3 or 4 players is the most fun in the long run, though. 2 players doing several rounds in a row will tend to fall into repetative patterns. In a group of 3 or 4 people naturally try different strategies and pick them up from each other, so the dynamics get a lot more interesting.",NA,"[5, 6]",0
Is this fun to play with only two players?,descriptive,"I have to say no, it's not worth it to play exclusively with two.

looking into getting  a ps4 for Christmas I played the first game and really liked it is this game on par or better then the first infamous?,descriptive,"Imo I think it's better than the first.  In this one, the graphics are gorgeous and every facial animation is incredible; I found myself deeply immersed during the cut scenes.  Also, the game play is phenomenal; and as you progress in the story they give you new powers; each very unique and different than the last; with each new power you get a whole new atomic bomb for it!  They also give you the choice to switch between the different powers when ever you want!  The only con about the game, imo, is the minor differences between the good/evil power sets; they are pretty much the same, but the different powers you get makes up for it.

"Hi, can this game be played with only 2 players or does it have to be 3 or more?",descriptive,"I would suggest playing with 3 or more players a few times so that you get a feel for how the game is suppose to be played.  After that, you can adjust the rules for a 2 player game.  Mainly it would be like Risk, where the 3rd player is neutral and only defends.  One thing my group has tried out a few times, and enjoy, is 2 people playing 2 or 3 families each so that there are 4-6 families being played.  Once again, you need to understand the rules so that you can adjust them without changing the game too much though.  Example would be that only one family can occupy a land area at a time, even if you are controlling both families. However, you can use other families ships for transport purposes.",NA,"[2, 2]",1

It takes out the random dice rolls of Risk (where a small number of defenders can hold off unbelievably vast numbers based on the rolls), but has more extensive variation and unpredictability than Diplomacy through its universal (non-directed) support, and its cards (the leader cards played with every battle and the end of turn cards).",NA,"[2, 2]",1
"Is this game a variation on Diplomacy?

"Is this game a variation on Diplomacy? That is, no dice rolls; your success comes down to skill at alliance-building and military strategy?",descriptive,"For the most part. There is an optional component (Tides of War, which comes with the game) that inserts an element of chance into battles. Outside of battles, there are a few examples of luck intervening in the game. Sometimes Wildlings attack, and this is determined by card drawing (which still allows for some strategizing, in the same way that Blackjack does). Other events around Westeros, such as stormy seas and bad harvests are also determined by card drawing. Still, military strategy and alliance building are the more important elements of the game.",NA,"[1, 2]",0
"Is this game a variation on Diplomacy? That is, no dice rolls; your success comes down to skill at alliance-building and military strategy?",descriptive,"Although I am not familiar with Diplomacy, I am familiar with A Game of Thrones. Much of the game does come down to alliance-building and troop positioning strategy. An element of randomness is introduced through the Westeros cards. These cards are drawn at the beginning of each turn before any orders are assigned. They affect all players equally at the beginning of any given turn. For example, some cards might have players adjust their supply tracks or muster additional troops. These cards affect all players equally, although there impacts on individuals' strategies could vary. Following the cards, a player can adjust his or her game strategy before assigning orders.Randomness is a component, but players are given time to react to it.

Possible purchase Does each person need his own banana?Not sure how this is played. I would be playing with my 8 year old granddaughter. Thanks! Mary,descriptive,"We play this same game simply by using the letters from a Scrabble game I got at the thrift store for $1.  My kids love it, so unless you ""need"" the banana pouch to store your letters, just go buy a used Scrabble game.  How the game is played: Lay all letters out showing blank side.  Each players picks 7 letters & begins to make their own crossword puzzle.  As soon as someone has used all their letters, they say ""Take 2!""  Which means everyone has to take 2 more letters.  As soon as a person has used all their letters again, they say ,""Take 2!"".  This goes on until all the letters are used up or you establish a time limit.

"Won't take off Got this for my son - fully charged, the rotors just spin and the copter spins around but it won't take off. Any ideas?",descriptive,"Typically, when the heli won't take off as you described, the battery is too weak or drained to spin the rotors fast enough to create sufficient lift.  (One needs to apply nearly full throttle to get the heli airborne; otherwise, it will just crab or spin without taking off.) Because you stated that the heli was fully charged, you probably have a bad Lipo battery if you applied full throttle.  (Lipo batteries can be damaged if they are drained below 3 volts as may happen if the heli is stored away for months, (e.g. old retail stock), or flown again without charging after the battery ""rebounds"" from a prolonged, nearly completely draining flight.)  Either take/send it back to the store where you purchased it for an exchange, or replace the Lipo battery under the canopy.  Some advanced chargers can restore an over drained battery, but these units cost much more than the S107.  Replacement batteries for the S107, (~150 mAh with protection circuit board), can be found on eBay for under three bucks per unit including shipping, but since most are sent from Hong Kong delivery can take up to two weeks or longer.By the way, the tail rotor only spins when the heli is flying backwards or forwards.

"Won't take off Got this for my son - fully charged, the rotors just spin and the copter spins around but it won't take off. Any ideas?",descriptive,"Today I had the same problem with a slightly different solution. Out of the box, no lift. Everything seemed to be tight and spinning. I checked all the previous posts and double checked the solutions. Nothing exactly matched. I then started to examine the copter. Looking at the gears, I noticed the very front gear was just slightly too low and not making full contact with the next gear. This is the gear that fully engages the lower set of blades. The fix is probably not for the faint of heart but I figured if I screwed it up bad enough I could probably still return it. So to start I had to remove the two screws that hold on the plastic nose cone. Note that all screws are extremely small, be careful. Then the next four screws that hold the body together had to be removed. Make sure to watch the chrome spacers as these will probably just fall of after, also not that the front set and back set are different sizes. Once the top and bottom can be slightly seperated, you can use a needle nose pliar to pull the front gear up just slightly so that it fully contacts the second gear. Then reasemble, probably the hardest part, remember those screws are small. Once back together I was flying in no time. Really a full charge is at most a half hour. I do recomend using an outlet and not a USB port, unless you know for sure that the USB port is powered. Again, most might just want to return it for a new one or different model all together, but I found this to be a project and had fun doing it.",NA,"[3, 4]",0

While at first it seemed like the battery was the issue (it's brand new, and I followed all the instructions on charging it), I think I've found the actual problem. When pushing full throttle my bottom rotor wouldn't turn sometimes, and if it did, it seemed rather weak. I first thought this was because the battery wasn't powered up enough, but after closer inspection, the bottom rotor was no longer stationary and was slipping as the motor spun. I have yet to fix it, because Im trying to figure out the best way, but people have used either epoxy (best glue) or hardcore tape (duct-tape).

Rear rotor won't turn - what to do,descriptive,"I have two suggestions for you. 1. Remove the plastic rotor. Make sure there isn't any hair wrapped around the post. It's amazing what these things can pick up when flying! 2. Purchase a new rotor because yours might be bent, keeping it from rotating. This happened to us before. You couldn't see the bend but when we replaced it, voila! If you've had this helicopter for awhile, it's possible that it's on its last leg. We have had these for several years and one is finally not turning the back rotor and it can't be fixed. We've gotten our money's worth out of it. However, if it's brand new, return it. Hope this helps!",NA,"[2, 2]",1

Could someone who is color blind participate?,descriptive,"Yes, take a sharpie and write the letter of the color on each card. (R, G, P) colorblind or not you can evaluate that attribute then. Will be interesting to see if others key in on the letter or  color as it is interesting how each person processes the set matches and exclusions differently.",NA,"[2, 2]",1

Can one person play this game?,descriptive,"ONE PLAYER VERSION: Here is a ""rule"" that's un-stated. ANY TWO CARDS are 2/3 of a 3-card ""set"". So, pick ANY two cards at random, and as quickly as you can, divine what the 3rd card should be. Say you pick ""ONE RED SOLID CAPSULE"" and ""ONE RED OPEN CAPSULE"". If you run through the 4 attributes (color / number / shape / shading ) you see ""red/red(need RED)"" / ""one/one(need ONE)"" / ""capsule/capsule(need CAPSULE)"" / ""solid/open(need ""hashed"").

"Monopoly vs CASHFLOW I am hoping to hear from people who actually HAVE, or have PLAYED:  Monopoly and the adult version of  CASHFLOWBesides price, how do they compare?  I've been trying to find out for a good while and I can't seem to find that information from anyone who has played both posted anywhere.  I have played Monopoly for years but from what I gather from comments on Amazon (and the CASHFLOW site), the games seem to have a different focus/lesson on looking at investing/saving money.  Can anyone elaborate on that point?",descriptive,"I have never played CLarge, but I think Cashflow is incredible. Cashflow is much more specific to the specifics in life...ie. having a baby and what effect it will have on your wallet. As a RE investor for 10 yrs now, I highly recommend the game, as it teaches ROI, what an income statement and balance sheet is. The bank (in real life) expects you to now what these are. The game teaches you what they are. I teach Cashflow in a public middle school-students love it and they begin to understand what passive vs. working income is.  I teach it to my own children as well. They ""get it"". I would recommend reading Rich Dad PDad first if you haven't.  The game may retail for $200, but from what I know now, I would have paid $2K for it. I never understood the concepts in monopoly b/c they were far too vague. When I played cashflow, I got it and knew I needed to change my buying habits from liabilities to assets. I love to shop! As of 10 yrs. ago I now shop for beautiful homes to lease to people, and they pay me $1000s of dollars to stay in my properties.",NA,"[2, 2]",1

does it have 48 individual slots??,yesno,"Its a bit difficult to explain. It has 16 small slots on the inner and 16 small slots on the outer. In the center of this is 3 big slots (one big slot is equal to 4 small slots). Between the big slots is 2 small slots. In other words, it is 6 across and 8 down which includes 3 big slots in the center. Therefore 16 (inner) + 16 (outer) + 4 (center) = 36 small slots and 3 big slots (center). It seems they counted the 3 big slots as 12 small slots, even though its not separated as a small slot. A big slot can fit a small monster truck very well with enough room to close the lid.",NA,"[3, 5]",0

Would this game be good for a child with Ausberger's?,descriptive,"Hi Sheryl, well I have actually worked in a Children's psych dept. for many years and would assume that the child has a good memory? Really that is what the game boils down to. Extremely good memorization skills. You pass by trees with a picture underneath as you are making your way to the castle. You have to try to remember where the tree is that is on the card at the castle and make it there before anyone else who may also have seen it. The trick is when someone rolls doubles, they have the option of changing the picture that you are looking for. Once that has been done, the next card is flipped to reveal another image which you may or may not have already seen. If you have, you can continue your way to the castle or keep gathering more locations on trees you pass by.  I think it would be frustrating for someone that doesn't have a good memory(such as myself sometimes).The younger kids seem to have such a photographic memory that they tend to do better at it. But it also comes down to who rolls of the dice get them to the spot where they can answer first. Hope this helps.",NA,"[3, 3]",1

How big is the board?,descriptive,"The board (excluding the frame) is 9"" x 7.5"". The actual playing area is 7.5"" x 7.5"", because there's an inch on the left for the letter distribution, etc., and half an inch on the right that's blank (so the two halves of the actual playing area are equal size). The tiles are 7/16"" square. They fit into a plastic grid. Each square in the grid is .5"", so there's a tiny space between the tiles when they're placed on the board.

"The board does not come with assembly instructions. How to set it up? The four color round buttons go in the top, but it doesn't power the board?",descriptive,"Richard- Depending on the voltage you need for your circuit you can either use battery packs (or 9-volt battery) with connectors to connect your power to the color buttons. If you're new to circuits work you may want to keep the color scheme simply. Hook battery pack or DC power supply positive wire (usually red) to Red power point, negative or ground wire (usually black) to Black power point. Use a small jumper wire to connect the Red power point to the red row in the top row of the bread (circuit) board. Do the same for the Black power point only connect it to the blue row in any of the holes in that row (same for red row above). You will now have power potential between those to rows of pin receptacles. Using additional small jumper wires you can connect those top rows(horizontal) to the corresponding vertical columns with the same color. You will now have power to the rest of the board for developing and testing your circuits. If you need more than 1 voltage source for your project you can use the Green & Yellow power points and feed specific columns directly from those power points with jumper wires. Remember to disconnect the jumper wires you may already have from the red row to that column you've just connected to one of the other color power points. Hope this helps",NA,"[2, 2]",1

Which skill level is this,descriptive,"There is no straight answer for this except maybe that is definitely not for beginners. I think the box says it is skill level  3 out of 5. If you have had any prior experience, this shouldn't be too difficult until you get to the rigging, which is fairly complex. The decks come in three pieces for each one and can be a bit tricky. This is a classic that almost anyone that builds model sailing ships ends up doing. You can easily take it to a level 5 by doing modifications, but straight out of the box, as I said, you should have built one or two models before this. A good one to learn from is the Revell Bounty in the same scale. A little less complex to build and to rig. Hope this helped.",NA,"[5, 5]",1

The weight of the child pushes the zebra down and allows it to spin (if she were standing next to it w/o pushing down, it would not move round) so by sitting on it my 6 year old spun himself in one full circle just to 'see if he could'.  They say the age goes up to about 36 months and the weight capacity is 43 lbs (my 6 year old is 41 lbs, just went to the annual checkup) It has been fun for the little one and is something nice and active for him to do now that the weather has turned cold and we can't go outside.

you see the image in color or black and white? I would like to know if you see the image in color or not because if not I wouldn't buy it.,descriptive,I bought this for my sons x-mas present.  I was curious and wanted to make sure everything worked before x-mas morning so I tested it out.  Mine is color.  The TV commerical is very accurate in my opinion.   The instructions do say if the picture is bad or grainy replace the batteries.  It also says the color may become distorted if left in one position for a long time. The instruction's solution was to turn it off and then back on. I didn't have any of these problems.  The focus area is small.  Objects need to be right up touching the Eye area.  Not a problem the instructions show you how to put the petree dish on top of the eye with the eye pointing upward.

Placing it this way allows for more water to collect in the pool which adds to the fun.

Thank you!",descriptive,"Intrigue is really interesting and a little more competitive and interactive. I have a few competetive people in my games group that really prefer all the dastardly cards that came with it. Its basically a remake of the original but it comes with the core cards required to play either two seperate games or one, larger game of 5-8 people. I cant recommend playing with any more than 6 though as the turns drag on too much. 1) Intrigue-- get it. The kingdom cards work well as expansion cards, and comes with the cards to play 2 games simultaneously or one game of 5-8 people. Its interactive and interesting. The keyword for Intrigue is: Interactivity 2) Prosperity-- Its fun to change the scale and dynamic of the game a bit. The addition of new, more valuable treasures and VP cards is cool and it adds a lot of interest/diversity without complicating the game at all. The keyword for Prosperity is: Scale/adding more strategy3) Seaside-- One of the best expansions out there that would go higher if it came with core cards (like intrigue) and was simpler (like prosperity). The biggest strength of Seaside is also its greatest weakness. It adds a lot of complexity to the game and slows down gameplay a bit. With 3 veteran players, its a blast but less experienced strategy tend to enjoy it a little less. Its barely noticeable but after numerous games I prefer to avoid Seaside for newbies, but love pulling a few cards from it for games with veterans. Embargo, Smugglers and Tactician are all game changers that many of my friends demand almost every game. ITs my personal favorite and high on everyone's list I know. 4) Cornucopia- its a fun expansion. It feels smaller in scope than all the ones above it because it is one of the smallest. The cards are interesting and reward players for having diversity in their deck. Its seemed less like a full fledged expansion to me and more like an expansion to draw on to keep players rewarded for a diverse deck. The tournament reward cards are great but I have yet to see a game where anyone has been awarded one. Pretty good expansion and it adds some depth  for experienced players that have played the rest but not a must-buy just because it isnt all that robust or inspired. 5) Alchemy- I have a few friends that like to play it. I think the second currency type (potions) waters down the game too much. Its probably the last expansion to get as its pretty polarizing. I even like a couple of fan expansions (Seasons of Change and Salvation) better than Alchemy. Great for a completionist but only someone interested in mixing up the whole treasure/VP/action card dynamic or really interested in the magic lore should invest in it before the other 4.

how is the game played?,descriptive,"That's a bit of a large question. If you want a full explanation of how to play the game, check out this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7WZMH-uzUI",NA,"[6, 6]",1
how is the game played?,descriptive,"It's a deck building game. This is unlike collectible card games (like Magic: The Gathering or the Pokemon trading card game), where you collect your own set of cards and decks on your own before you play, and your deck generally doesn't change during the game.  In Dominion all players start with the same small deck, and the rest of the cards in the game are in the center of the table (i.e., the Supply), and you use your deck to buy or otherwise acquire more cards for your deck. There are a few different types of cards to acquire to help you win (note that the specifics here apply to the basic game of Dominion shown here; expansions to the game are available that include more complicated cards and some new mechanics, but they are pretty easy to figure out once you know the basics):- Treasure cards - These cards are used to buy more cards for your deck (each card in the supply has a price, in coins, you need to pay in order to buy them).  In the base version of Dominion, the three basic treasure cards are Copper (worth 1 coin), Silver (2 coins), and Gold (3 coins).  Every game of Dominion always has these basic treasure cards available in the supply. Your starting deck starts with 7 coppers, and you can use these to buy the more valuable treasures to increase your buying power on each turn.- Victory cards - These cards have a victory point amount on them.  Every game of Dominion will have three basic victory cards:  Estate (worth 1 victory point), Duchy (3 VPs), and Province (6 VPs).  There are also some other victory cards that vary depending on the game.  Everyone starts with 3 Estates in their starting deck.  At the end of the game, you count up the number of victory points in your deck, and the person with the most wins.  So you need victory cards in your deck to win the game.  However, during play, victory cards don't have any other effects, so they are kind of like dead cards in your hand (taking up spots that could be used instead by more useful cards).  You need to balance the victory cards you buy with other cards that can help you during the game.- Curse cards - These are basically the same as victory cards, except they are worth -1 victory point.  You wouldn't probably never buy these yourself, but there are other cards that your opponents could play that make you add them to your deck.- Action cards - These cards have various effects during the game.  They may let you draw more cards into your hand (typically you draw 5 cards into your hand each turn), they may let you buy multiple cards during your turn (typically you can only buy one per turn), they may let you play more actions during your turn (you start with only one action you can play), they may let you modify your deck by acquiring cards outside of the buying phase or trading in a card for a better one.  There are also so attacking actions, that make your opponents discard cards from their hand, show and/or give you cards from their decks, or gain curses.  Finally, there are action cards called Reactions, which allow you to react to what your opponent does during their turn (in the base game, the one reaction card is called Moat, and it lets you disregard an opponent's attack on you).  The specific action cards in any game can vary from game to game.- Trash - Dominion also comes with a trash card.  This isn't a card you would purchase to put in your deck, it is a marker to show where the trash pile goes.  There are some action cards which allow you to trash cards, meaning take them out of your deck and remove them from the game permanently.To start the game, you put out the basic treasure, victory and curse cards into the Supply (the amount of victory and curse cards vary on the amount of players), and set up the trash pile.  You also select 10 kingdom cards to include in the supply (kingdom supplies usually have 10 cards each, unless it is another victory card, which again varies depending on the number of players).  Most kingdom cards are actions, but there can be other types as well: the base game include a special Victory card called Gardens which can be one of the 10 kingdom piles, and the expansions include special treasure cards, victory cards, and combination cards that are of two different types.  The base game comes with 25 different kingdom card piles, so you can create a ton of different combinations of 10 from that.  And the expansions all add more kingdom cards that can be used instead (you can use kingdom cards from one or multiple expansions in a single game).Each player takes their 7 coppers and 3 estates as their starting deck, shuffles them, and places them face down to create a draw pile.  Each play draws 5 cards from their draw pile and the game starts.During your turn, the steps of your turn are:  Action, Buy, Clean Up and Draw (remember A B C D).  Action:  You can play one action card and do what the card says.  Some action cards will give you more actions to play, so you may end up playing more than one action card during your turn.  However you must play actions during this phase only (you can't play any more actions once you get to the buy phase, and you can't play any treasure cards during this phase).  Note that you do not have to play an action if you don't want to, or don't have one to play (during the first two turns of the game, no one will have any actions, so you usually just go right to the buy phase).Buy:  You can play any/all of your treasure cards at this point, and buy a card from the supply using the coins you get from your treasure cards, along with any actions cards in play (some action cards give you extra coins to use when buying).  Each card's cost is on the bottom left corner.  You start with one buy per turn, meaning you can buy one card.  Action cards could give you more buys, however.  If you have multiple buys, you still need enough coins to buy all the cards you want to purchase (if you want to buy a card costing 4 coins and a card costing 3, you would need 7 coins from your actions and treasures in play, along with an extra buy). Any cards you buy go into your discard pile, you can't use them right away (more on this in the clean-up phase).  In fact, unless the card tells you otherwise, any time you gain a card it goes into your discard pile.  Note that you don't have to use all of your buys, you can even decide to not buy anything if you choose during your turn.Clean-up:  Once your done buying, all cards that are in play or in your hand go into the discard pile, which is a face up pile next to your deck.  Normally, no cards from your current turn come with you to your next turn (There are some special cards in some expansions that don't get cleaned up right away, but I'll skip these for this explanation).Draw:  You draw 5 cards from your deck to create your new hand.  If you're draw pile becomes empty, you take your discard pile, shuffle it and place it face down to create a new draw pile.  Note that you should draw until the draw is empty before shuffling the discard pile (if you need to draw 5 cards, but only have 2, you draw the 2 cards, shuffle your discard pile, then draw 3 more cards).  This is how your new cards you've acquired/bought get used later in the game.  Once your draw your 5 new cards your turn is over, and it's the next player's turn.Play continues until either the Province pile is empty (this is the highest point total and most expensive victory card in a typical game), or three other piles of cards in the supply are empty.  Once the game ends, everyone gathers their deck (from their draw pile, discard pile, hand, etc.), counts the victory points, and the person with the most wins.There are some other rules about breaking ties and some other minutiae, but I think the above describe the basic gist of the game and how its played (particularly with the base game without any of the expansions).  The directions for the game are pretty clear and easy to refer to as you play.  There is a separate booklet which describes each kingdom card in detail, in case there are any special cases that have to be considered when performing an action, so you can usually determine what the correct behavior of a card is if there is ever a question.",NA,"[7, 7]",1
how is the game played?,descriptive,"Even if you're not familiar with deckbuilding games, they aren't hard to understand.  In Dominion, each player starts with a small deck of cards (10 in this case), and ""buys"" cards from a common pool during their turn (using treasure cards in their hand as currency), and adds them to their discard pile, which will eventually get shuffled back into the deck.  There is a lot of choices as to what cards can be bought on each turn, so each player's deck becomes different as the game progresses.",NA,"[3, 3]",1

dream town house elevator? are they kidding? please help-how do I get the darn thing hooked up? The instructions did not help at all...,descriptive,"I agree the instructions were pathetic, but once you see it, it is simple, so I will try to describe it to you. First, the elevator itself should already have snapped into place so it goes up and down freely. There is a box-like location that will allow it to go up and down freely.Next, the string will need to be straightened out end-to-end all the way...there is no doubling of it anywhere. You will notice that each of the end pieces inserts into one side of the elevator or the other, top and bottom, and each end is different, so make a note of which one is which. Now from underneath, you will feed the bottom side of the string through the hole (roughly bottom left) that is the roughly the size of a quarter from underneath (I was purposefully redundant) the dollhouse and snap it into place. Run the excess underneath the dollhouse to the front through the little slot that is at the very bottom, about 1/2 inch to the left of the front column. Run the excess up the three guide holes that are directly in front of the left columns, up over the top of the roof, dropping down through the center hole into the elevator shaft, and snap the other connector into the top center of the elevator.From there use the jewel to move it up and down, taking it out of the guide holes as necessary. I will note that if you have any trouble getting the fireplace to work, there is a button directly behind the T.V. button that makes it work. The fireplace is probably detached from the wall, and snapping it back into place will make the T.V. button activate the fireplace. If you GENTLY pull the top of the fireplace forward, you can see there are two hooks on the back wall. Re-seat the fireplace on them by gently pushing back until they click and you will be all set.My 5-year old got this from Santa this morning, and she is loving it. Merry Christmas.",NA,"[17, 18]",0

Is this item really appropriate for a 6 year old or will it be frustrating? Most reviews seem to be for kids a couple years older. Thank you,descriptive,"I looked back for my review on this from last year:  I was so excited when I saw this because my daughter was really into making friendship bracelets. But, after we received it and she tried using it, we discovered that this is not a good buy. The storage compartment is a great idea, but its much too small to store enough threads. The clamp on top that holds all the ends of the thread is not very tight, so if you're putting in more than a few pieces, it does slide around. Lastly, there are not enough slots to hold complicated designs. We ended up returning this.I think, overall, I would not recommended this.

The lower voltage LiPo yes, but by the time you get the charger & batteries & make sure all the connectors are going to match,- you could have just bought another car with everything included & actually be using all of what you just purchased.  Then in the event of a return you are dealing with one manufacturer & without having made perminent mounting modifications to get the battery connectors to fit in the event they don't match the picture.  Yes, the buggy looks nice, but it is too close to the ground & picks up a lot of junk from the lawn & dumps it inside & for what you are paying it should not need so much work right out of the box to get it to run reasonably & actually be fun.

The engine codes work like this (Impulse)(Thrust)-(Recovery charge delay).Recovery wadding - This is a flame resistant paper that you stuff into the rocket.

what other items do I need to purchase for the set to work?,descriptive,"You will need to purchase the rocket engines.  They are sold in packages of three and come complete with wadding and igniters.  Estes recommends B4-2 for the 1st flight of the Amazon (larger rocket) and B4-4, B6-2, C6-3 and C6-5 are also compatible.  The Crossfire (smaller rocket) will accept A8-3 (first flight), B4-4, C6-5 and C6-7.  You will also need to purchase both plastic model cement and wood glue (white school glue okay) for assembly.  Lastly you will need to purchase a small can of spray primer, a small can of white spray paint and a can of clear spray paint (optional) to finish the smaller rocket as it is constructed from paper tube and balsa wood with a plastic nose cone.  The larger rocket is mostly plastic, already finished and just requires stickers to be placed after assembly.  The only tools required to assemble either rocket are an exacto knife, a small piece of fine sandpaper and scissors.  The larger rocket is much easier to assemble and I would recommend tackling that one first.  It also accepts many of the same engine sizes as the smaller one so you may get by with purchasing just a couple of sizes.  Engines are selected by letter with A being the weakest and D being the most powerful.  The first number after the letter type represents how many seconds the ""burn"" is and the last number represents the delay before deploying the parachute.  Choose accordingly and start with the lower powered engines first to properly test your rocket and confirm your launch location is big enough.  Trees, wind, houses and fenced in yards with dogs can be potential setbacks.  My son and I had to contend with all of these our first launch despite utilizing a local park with six or seven acres of open area.  Hope this helps.",NA,"[5, 5]",1
what other items do I need to purchase for the set to work?,descriptive,"This package includes everything except the rocket engines. (And the batteries for the launch control).The engines are on the expensive side. You can purchase them in packets of three, but the most economical way to buy them is this box set:Estes Blast Off Flight Pack Rocket EnginesThe set also includes wadding, which you need.When you fly your rockets, start with the smallest engines (the ones with an 'A' on the side and with the lowest number). Insert the engine into the chamber at the base of the rocket, place the ignition wire (included in the box set) into the hole in the engine and plug it with the pink or yellow plastic plug (also included). Insert the wadding into the main cylinder of the rocket - it should fit loosely, not too tight. Its job is to catch the flying sparks from the engine so as not to damage the rocket. Then put the nosecone on. Set the rocket on the launchpad so that the long launchpad wire goes through the small rings on the side of the rocket. Then attach the two wires using the crocodile clips to the protruding wires of the igniter sticking out of the bottom of the rocket. Stand back as far as the wire will reach. Insert the safety key into the launch control and push it in HARD. If you have a working circuit, the white LED will shine brightly. If it does, you can push the big button to launch.One other note: a lot of rockets are lost in trees because they go pretty high and the wind carries them away. Never launch anything you are not willing to lose! Unless you have a VERY large field nearby where you can launch, you might find it better to skip the parachute provided in your set and just attach a long ribbon or streamer instead.

"the eng.A8-3 dont fire, why?",descriptive,"It could be a bad launcher, bad igniter, poor igniter contact, or a bad engine.  Frequently the igniters can break if not handled properly.  Check to make sure the ignition residue hasn't come off or cracked.  Replace the igniter if it has.  Make sure it has contact with the engine.  Next, try a different engine.  Lastly, try new batteries in the igniter.  The igniter key has to be inserted and pushed firmly (and held) and the light will come on.  At this point, you can hit the launch button.",NA,"[3, 3]",1
"the eng.A8-3 dont fire, why?",descriptive,"Most likely reason is that there is a short somewhere along the line.  Check to make sure the ignitor leads haven't been squeezed together so they touch.  Work your way back to the clips.  Are the clips touching each other or the rod or the blast deflector?  If so, that could short it out.  Are you using a new battery?  After a dozen launches or so, they really don't have the power for instant ignition.  In a safe place,  do the continuity check that the instructions describe.  Then try lighting an ignitor that is not hooked to an engine.  When attempting to launch, hold the key in firmly so the light is steady, then hold the launch button for a few seconds, not just a quick push.  If all that fails, call Estes or Quest or whoever made your engine and see if there was a bad lot.",NA,"[2, 2]",1

I don't want to do it to mine but I think you would need to do a ponytail either high up or at the back of the neck to keep her scalp covered with hair.

I particularly the fact that it is cooperative - you really have to work together as a team to succeed.  On that note, I've noticed that there is a difference when 4 play compared with 3, since each additional player assumes the role of a character with skills to help the team (engineer, pilot, explorer, etc.), so when you have more players, you have more skills to draw upon as a team - which might affect how the game goes with just two players.

Are the legos large size,descriptive,"Not sure what you mean by large.  The blocks themselves are the DUPLO size blocks - meant for preschoolers - not choking hazard size. They're about 1""x1"" at the smallest.  The box is about 10 inches by 16 by 16.  There's 102 pieces I think in the box, which may not sound like a lot but we didn't feel cheated - they are a good variety of pieces and sizes. Glad we got it.",NA,"[2, 2]",1
Are the legos large size,descriptive,"It is certainly bigger than the normal lego and it is not of choking hazard size. There are 102 pieces in it with a variety of colours, shapes and sizes. Personally I feel the size is just right for a longer span of use. Kids can use it till they are older and they can even combine with the smaller lego sets in future. There are larger blocks though in the market by other brands. Those are very much bigger.  Probably easier for 1-2 year old to take apart and fix. However I am satisfied with my purchase as the quality is good and it is safe for my 18 months twins. Also the variety of blocks in this set is very good. But these are not as big as the mega blocks. It is very much smaller. Will take longer for my kids to learn how to build with it.",NA,"[2, 2]",1

Will this tool cut through EVA foam?,descriptive,It should be able to cut through EVA foam with a thickness less than 1/2 inch due to the blade width.

Why does this cost $200? It was about $50 when I last looked...,descriptive,"The game is out of stock and probably between print runs, probably due to being featured on the web show Tabletop.

If you are patient you will get a copy for $50 or less when the next printing comes out.,NA,"[2, 2]",1
Why does this cost $200? It was about $50 when I last looked...,descriptive,Greed.

can this game be played with 2?,yesno,"It is not recommended by the manufacturer, but this game can indeed be played with two.  I have played it with two players before and it is still pretty fun.  However, the game plays best with 4-5 players.If you are playing with two players, I would recommend each player choosing two characters.  When the haunt starts, the person who became the traitor gives up his non-traitor character to the other player and then they control three characters while the traitor only controls one.  This can get a little tricky for certain haunts where the traitor or number of traitors can change, but it works pretty well for most haunts.  If the traitor does find a haunt where the traitor or number of traitors can change, they can simply choose a haunt from the same room, but with a different omen that is already in play.",NA,"[2, 2]",1

All you need is a standard electric pump that you would use for any inflatable - balls, floaties for the pool, etc.  We got a Coleman QuickPump Electric pump for around $25 at Walmart.

"Wich is better to align: SkyScout Personal Planetarium, SkyQ Link Wi-Fi Adapter, NexGuide Autoguider, Starsense autoalign, SkySync GPS Accessory?",descriptive,"I can't answer your whole question but I can tell you what I know about a some of the Celestron products you mentioned. The sky sync GPS does not align it just enters time and location so you don't have to, the Skysync can also be used together with other accessories like Starsense for example. The Star Sense Autobalign will read the stars automatically so you don't have to do an alignment manually. The SkyQ Link will enter your time and location via your mobile device and then you can use your mobile device (iPad) to control you telescope, however you will have to align your scope first and the current model does not work with the Starsense accessory.",NA,"[2, 2]",1
How do you power this thing?,descriptive,"Power comes from the mount, the cord that connects to the mount. Plug it into the AUX jack and it's set to go. Works great, sets my exact time and location in about 30 seconds.",NA,"[2, 2]",1
How do you power this thing?,descriptive,"The aforementioned is correct (the AUX port directly on top of the Alt-Az base). I have a Nexstar 8SE Alt-Az mount. I also have a CG-5 Equatorial of which it is not compatable with. Remember to enable the GPS through the Nexstar menu once the system powers up. You will no longer have to enter time, date, location, etc. Give the system a few moments to triangulate its position. Make sure that you have a clear line of site to the sky so that you can get a good GPS lock.",NA,"[2, 2]",1
How do you power this thing?,descriptive,It receives its power from the telescope by way of the AUX connection. The GPS unit itself does not take batteries or have an A/C connection.,NA,"[2, 2]",1
How do you power this thing?,descriptive,"You plug it into the auxiliary port of your celestron telescope.  When you power up the scope, it's on.  You need to tell the handset to use it in the menu settings.",NA,"[2, 2]",1
How do you power this thing?,descriptive,"I plugged my Celestron SkySync GPS directly into the AUX port on my CGEM mount.  The red light on the GPS unit should come on once you turn your mount on.  You do have to activate it (turn the GPS tracking on) though using the hand remote (menu, utilities, turn on GPS).  Also, you need to make sure your hand remote is set for the correct time; standard time or daylight savings time (menu, scope set-up, view time site).  Once you do this you should be good to go.  Hope this helps.",NA,"[2, 2]",1
"With the GPS will I dispense with this products: ""NexGuide Autoguider"" and ""Starsense autoalign""?",descriptive,"The short answer is no. The GPS only provides accurate latitude, longitude and time rather than you entering them manually. This is especially helpful when you observe from multiple locations. The Starsense provides telescope alignment with the sky after the GPS has done its job. The auto guider tracks a star closely to keep the telescope on subject for photography without star trails in the image.",NA,"[2, 2]",1

does this kit have the parts for the 1701A build included ??,yesno,"No, this is the original series Enterprise.  I first 1000 kits had options to build the first and second pilot versions, which differed from the production version . . . most obviously they didn't have the lights on the front of the engines.  This model is engineered better than Polar Lights Enterprise 1701A kit.  Parts fit together perfectly with only minor seams, and the parts are very solid . . . no sag or droop from the nacelles or saucer.  Also, if you put lights in the model (which I did) there are parts that snap into place so you can get into the model and repair shorts or bad LED's as needed.  In fact, I built the model, painted and finished it, and then added the lighting when it was done . . . that way you don't have to worry about breaking a connection you can't get to when you are manhandling the model.  In fact, I have never even glued down the saucer section or the nacelles . . . they sort of snap into place . . . so if we ever have to move I can take it apart, disconnect wires, and pack it into a box.  That is something I could never do with my 1701A.",NA,"[3, 3]",1

"can plastic resins be used with this mold material, or just miiput and clay?",descriptive,I have used this on plastic pieces to make copies for lost/broken piece and it worked well.

"So is this product good for making casts of action figure heads, weapons, etc; then using milliput or another sculpt to make a copy?",descriptive,Yes - you can make nice casts of items with good detail and then use another medium to build - I used green stuff myself.  On point to mention - I tried this with resin plastics and the heat created by the plastic destroyed the mold - I did get a decent copy.  I just melted the instant mold and used it again with no real harm.  Very nice to those one off molds you may need.,NA,"[2, 2]",1

I thanked them and bought something else, the Melissa and Doug stacker made of wood and lead-free paint. Fisher-price, shame on you for not being upfront about this.

The Man fire truck does not have doors that open, and the stabilizers are stored on the back of the truck such that they have to be removed and attached on (unless of course they have disappeared into a toy box).  The Scania truck also has more sounds than the Man truck.  I'm pretty sure the Scania truck's ladder extends taller than the Man truck, but I am not with the vehicles at the moment to confirm that.

Is this good for a begginer?,descriptive,"Yes this plane is outstanding for a begginer, That was the reason I bought it. I have tried 2 other begginer planes that cost more money and have not lasted half as long. I have crashed a few times and had to use some foam glue(not super glue) to get the plane back to flying but nothing major that needed me to buy replacment parts for the plane. I have nose dived into the ground, hit a fence a few times even hit a tree and the plane is still flying great. The controller is simple and will not confuse a new flyer, the gyro system in the plane is great and will keep the plane level while flying. Hope this answered your question and if you have more feel free to askVR James",NA,"[2, 2]",1
Is this good for a begginer?,descriptive,My first plane was this one and the super cub also by the same seller. I found the piper super cup RTF to be the easiest to fly. The stratos can have a lazy rudder and therefore not so responsive. The super cub is very responsive and also comes with anti crash technology making it stable at the same time. I soon upgraded my remote controller to an after market Spectrum DSMX 6 channel which made flying these planes twice as better. I'm now addicted to the hobby so be careful. It's a lot of fun! Also flight simulator CDROM programs are worth the money vs. ruining your plane. Practice on the computer with a modern version so you don't completely ruin your investment.,NA,"[3, 3]",1

does it come with the charger?,yesno,"Yes, it includes a battery and a charger.  The charger is for a car cigarette lighter, for around 12v.  I bought two additional batteries and a nicer charger on the advice of a friend who is an avid RC flyer.  I actually like the nicer charger that I bought since it tells how many mAH (milli-amp hours, a measure of electrical current) the battery took to charge.  That is handy because I can then tell how much of the batteries charge I was using.",Y,"[2, 2]",1
does it come with the charger?,yesno,It comes with a 12 volt charger that is compatible with a car's cigarette lighter outlet.

"Flight Time Are there any helicopters appropriate for 5-7 year olds with a flight time longer than a few minutes, but still durable?",descriptive,"You can get larger batteries for these to last longer. I am ordering some 145 or some 150 mah and they have larger ones I think.  Not sure of a 5-7 years olds skill, but if you get this heli and trim it for them and tech them, they should be able to learn. Just order some spare parts online so if you do break something you can fix quickly and fly some more.  But I would not use larger capacity batteries and fly 2 of them back to back, I would let the motors cool some first.  I am looking into adding some very lightweight heatsinks to both the main and tail motor on mine to keep them cooler for longer run-time batteries.  The micro sized Walkera Super FP, I think has much larger batteries and is very very durable. I am looking into one of those with brush-less motors, but it cost 3 times this heli and that is with no transmitter.  they sell a non-brush-less version with a TX for a little over double this heli. But this is a great and affordable heli to start with so I would say get one and order some more batteries and spare parts. I ordered main and tail motor spares from the Nine eagles Bravo SX cause they are said to be better. But some say they never changed a motor out.",NA,"[4, 4]",1
"Flight Time Are there any helicopters appropriate for 5-7 year olds with a flight time longer than a few minutes, but still durable?",descriptive,"No problem. check out some rc forums there are many people who mod this heli and TONS of info on it out there. There are parts from others helis that fit cause this is a cross clone of a couple other models out there.  It is real fun and easy to fly.  I crashed into the gutter head on and then to the ground with no damage. I only crashed so bad cause I was trying to fly in wind the was more than it ""can"" handle.  I didnt crash after that though.The top left button on the TX is for double rate for outdoor and wind use. It give you more servo control.  To see which way it is set, while on the ground and no throttle, push the right stick to the left or right and if the LCD screen on the TX shows the bars going all the way left or right it is set for outdoor/wind. Hit the button on the top left and then push the right stick again (l/r) and you will then see the bars go about 3/4 f the way showing servo movement.  I only use the x2 servo movement button when flying outside. This way I dont have as much movement to hit something indoors.  You'll see once you get one (if you do).I also hit a chair a couple times and had a few hard landings and it is flexible so ""so far"" (knock on wood) I have yet to break anything. have some spares and more stuff and mods on order.  It comes with spare tail rotor and main blades. Got 4 extra flybars for about $3, got more blades and got a few set of buckles for the swash-plate connections.  I also ordered cnc aluminum swashplate and main shaft kit and more.... The stuff is cheap for this thing anyway. Wish amazon sold spare parts on here, but they dont (yet). they are easy to locate though.Some peolple say they order from places direct from China cause of cheap prices, but for me that is ok on spare parts, but I prefer to not deal with shipping back to china if I get a damaged heli sent out etc. So I ordered from Amazon. I got the red and white one cause it was a little cheaper on here. I feel safer buying from Amazon over many other places (especially when it is something that is shipped from an Amazon warehouse so I can use my Prime to get free 2-day shipping). I never had any trouble that wasnt quickly sorted out.",NA,"[3, 3]",1

Is the single propeller harder to fly then the dual propeller,descriptive,I don't know because it was Dead On Arrival.  The radio would not light up with fresh batteries in it and neither would the chopper after charging for 48 hours.  Nothing would work.  I ended up getting one locally made by World Tech Toys.  It operates on 49 MHz RF so you can fly it farther up and away from your position.  It is built a lot tougher than the one pictured here.

In D&D; we adopted a quick strategy of keeping the tanks together and having the Rogue often sprint to the objective.  M&M; offers more strategy of keeping certain characters together, having distanced damage where a character can be safe, or having a character search for new items/treasure.

Does it have six axis control and return to home features,descriptive,"six-axis, in this case, refers to the fact that this quad has both a gyroscope AND an accelerometer on board - it has nothing to do with the number of control channels on the radio.  the addition of the accelerometer grants the quad extremely stable flight (in stability mode) - it is used to eliminate drift and to precisely control roll, pitch, and yaw.  in case you are wondering, both the gyroscope and the accelerometer chips have three axis (x, y, and z) - hence the six-axis wording.it does not have return to home, but you really dont need that on a quad that is not designed to fly further than you can see.  RTH certainly won't prevent the quad from being blown into a tree during high winds, as the user ""Teenage Driver"" has asserted.  in fact, while RTH might seem like a good feature for a beginner, it is something that should only be used by a more advanced pilot who understands the limitations of the technology.  this quad is PERFECT for anyone who is looking to get into the hobby.  it flies beautifully!",NA,"[2, 2]",1
Does it have six axis control and return to home features,descriptive,"I own one and it does NOT have 'return to home'.  It does have six axis control.  Since mine is parked high up in a tree because of lack of skill, wind and lack of GPS I would highly recommend spending the extra money on a GPS enabled model.",NA,"[2, 3]",0
Does it have six axis control and return to home features,descriptive,"It does not have  a "" Return Home"" feature. Although, a hobby store rep told me it did. I'm not sure about the six axis control. It has up and down elevation. Bank left and right. Rotate 360 left or right. Forward and reverse. It also has a 3 stage switch to adjust the sensitivity of the controls. 1=Beginners, 2=Intermediate and 3=Advanced. Stage 3 is very responsive. Hope this helps.",NA,"[2, 3]",0
Does it have six axis control and return to home features,descriptive,"Yes and no. But not too sophisticated. It's got up and down, rotate right and left, and go left and right. But, NO return home stuff. That requires GPS and the 180 does not have that. But, having said that, it's a great training quad. You have to pay attention all the time - or else lose control, lose sight, and lose the quad. I have trouble telling if it's gaining altitude sometimes. The camera isn't bad - for what it is. Since it records sound, any videos you take will have loud rotor noise. It's fast, and depending on how you set the controls, you can do all sorts of acrobatics with it too. It's fast and responsive, but the battery only lasts about 10 or so minutes. I still love it though. It's a fun little intro quad. Give it a go.",NA,"[2, 3]",0
Does it have six axis control and return to home features,descriptive,"It doesn't have return to home.  I wish it did that would be a real plus when things get out of control on windy days.

Do these stay on track or do they fly off easily at every bend like the old slot cars used to?,descriptive,"They really do stay on the track!

Do these stay on track or do they fly off easily at every bend like the old slot cars used to?,descriptive,They do fly off every now and again.

Are the graphics that different compared to last-gen (e.g. PS3)?,descriptive,"I haven't personally played either of the previous generation console(PS3/X-Box 360) version so I couldn't answer your question so I briefly checked for comparison videos to see if I could discern any major differences. I personally am a fan of ign so I went to their video, ""Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition - PS4/PS3 Comparison and Analysis"" and if amazon allowed links, I would share the video with you. You can find it on youtube as well. I was expecting to not see a major difference but I was quite surprised to see that Laura character model look significantly better then the older generation version. Her hair, skin and clothe look much more detailed and realistic(Especially her hair). The environment has sharper details as well and certain scenes had nice particle effects that were not in the previous generation. If I were you I would search for that video as I think this is a matter of personal preference. If you already own a previous generation copy, I find it hard to recommend you get the newer one. However, there are features that I ASSUME aren't in the previous generation, for example the ability to call out via voice for ""show map"", ""pistol"", ""bow"", ""regular(arrows)"", ""fire(arrows)"" or using the touch pad to look around the map or examine artifacts.

How does this compare to Phase 10 card game?  It sounds kind of similar.,descriptive,"It's a rummy style game complete with sets and runs.

ok for five year old,descriptive,"We played ""teams"" with our 7 yr. old granddaughter as it was difficult for her to figure out how to move the board pieces to make a pathway to the picture that she needed to get to.  The more players you have playing, the more difficult it is to plan ahead for your path.  You see, every time someone moves the board, the paths change.  So if four people are playing, then the other three people will each move the board paths in their turn; which means that the paths will be changed three times before you get to move again.  If four people play as two teams, then it makes the game easier and teachable as your team will only have to wait one turn (and thus one board paths change) before you can go again.",NA,"[5, 5]",1

I did not want to risk the potential ""frustration level"" of the M-gears for 8 years and up.  Our son, as yours must be, is very mechanical/engineer/construction minded and he could probably be able to do the M-gears, HOWEVER, I want him to also be able to play individually, alone with the set as well as playing with his 10 year old sister, mom and dad!!   Being able to construct on his own is very important - builds self-esteem.  I would hate to have him frustrated all of the time and having to constantly ask for help!!  I wish the company would develop ""connectors"" so that the Gears set would work with the M-gears, where a connector had a large connection for the Gears set, and a much smaller connection for the M-gears.

I'd like to purchase this pool to use at my homebirth. How do you drain it when it's indoors?,descriptive,"Since our yard is lower than pool, I used garden hose to siphon the water out the window.  It took about an hour, but I didn't need to buy a pump of any sort.  The easiest way to do this is to put one end of the hose into the pool and keep adding hose, letting it fill up with the pool water until the entire hose is in the pool and submerged.  Then, fold the end of the hose over 2 or 3 times so that no air will come into it when you pull it out.  Hand the end to someone outside or tape it so it doesn't unfold and pass it through the window.  On the outside, pull the hose to a good draining location that is lower than the floor of the pool inside; the lower it is, the faster the flow.  Now, undo the end of the hose and watch as the water flows out.  Have fun.",NA,"[3, 3]",1
I'd like to purchase this pool to use at my homebirth. How do you drain it when it's indoors?,descriptive,"Take a hose, place one end in the filled indoor pool, and the other end outside where the water can go. Get a suction going (by mouth by sucking on the outdoor end until the water comes through) or by using a syphoning pump, then leave it alone until it is drained; similar to syphoning gas from a car to a gas can. Otherwise, use a bucket until it is bailed out like a boat. Use towels to get the remaining puddles out of the pool. Good luck. Try looking up how to syphon.",NA,"[4, 5]",0

How long does it take to fill the pool?,descriptive,Well it depends on who you fill it.

When I got in the pool he was still filling it and dumped a bucket of water on me. :) haha...I strangely didn't really want my husband near me and was happy he was busy filling the tub. :) Eat a nice meal of eggs toast butter and milk in the beginning of your labor and that will help you have all the energy you need to birth this baby.

Would a bright 11 year old girl who is into science like this toy?,descriptive,"My son is 6 and gifted in Math and Science. He really enjoys it putting the configurations together then seeing what happens if he changes something around.  You might think of it as advanced Legos - you put the bricks in the right order and you can make something interesting happen. The kids get a pretty good idea of how curcuits, resistors, etc work.  If your child is interested in electronics, its is definately a good introduction.  The 300 set comes with two booklets with a couple hundred projects/configurations.  I believe they get progressively more difficult, but we are still on the first book.  In the first book, the changes between one project and the next are sometimes minimal, but I believed designed to help the student understand how little changes can make a different outcome in the project.  I hope this helps.",NA,"[2, 2]",1
Would a bright 11 year old girl who is into science like this toy?,descriptive,"My grandson is younger but way ahead of his age and my nephew is 7 and both are addicted to this.

"'Axis And Allies' vs Risk: What is the best board wargame in the world? Hi,I have never bought or played any of these board wargames but I am very interested now after reading about it.I love the complexity these types of wargames appear to have because I love games like chess and Go. I also like the fact the playing of these wargames can last a very long time, as compared to most other board games, during the course of a single game (up to five hours or more I have heard).I have a small circle of friends that are intellectuals and we would all love to play a game like these which are complex, require analytical and strategic thinking and are long-lasting. So Im thinking of buying one for all of us. However, considering the price of these games, up to $200, I do not know which one to get. I am looking for the most complex board heavy wargame possible, as apposed to a ""light"" wargame which is easier to play and less complex. Now I believe 'Risk' is easier to play then 'Axis And Allies'and Risk is more for younger people rather then a 27 year old like meself, is this true? Which one is better in our opinion Axis And Allies or Risk? Or if you know of another 'heavy wargame' that is even more complex and is long-lasting then thats even better for me and my friends... so please let me know of the most complex heavy wargame that you know of, if you know of one that is. If you do not know of such a super-complex wargame then I suppose I will either go for 'Risk' or 'Axis And Allies'...whichever you guys/girls like suggest.thanks,Stephen Tobin",descriptive,"Hello Everyone!I have both Risk and the Original Axis and Allies games and we play both frequently since we are in the military.I must agree with Greg, when it comes to the differences. Risk is the childrens version of Axis and Allies. While their is strategy involved in Risk, Axis and allies requires much more strategy and money management to be successful.We play risk on friday nights because its a quick way to have a war and end it in enough times to head out drinking. Once a month around noon, we play Axis and Allies, and it lasts pretty much the whole day when we have someone new playing. When all of our experienced players show up, it lasts the weekend.I have a rule to where you can be the same country twice in a row. It changes up the results and gives everyone the chance to learn the stragies and styles of all fo the countries. I have seen the allies win more than the Axis, but i have seen the Axis destroy when the right people have control of them and if they act swiftly.Both games are fun, but ill have to say that if you are looking to have wars that will give your friends a real reason for saying things like "" Down With America!"" then Axis and Allies is a must!",NA,"[2, 2]",1

In Risk, there are only one type of unit, men, you can have cannons, which are 10 men, horses, which are 5 men, or men, which are 1 man. In Axis and Allies you have bombers, fighters, anti-aircraft guns, infantry, tanks, submarines, and transport ships. It takes a lot to win in Axis and Allies compared to Risk. In A&A; you have to conquer 12 cities, such as Rome, Pairs, Los Angeles, ect. In Risk, you play till you conquer the map or until someone concedes, which takes half the time because the fighting in Risk is so much more simple then in A&A.; Overall, Risk is more about luck than strategy, and takes 6 hours tops. A&A; is more about strategy. You have to worry about your money(there is none in Risk) and your cities(there are none in original Risk). If you want the best strategy war game out there, buy A&A;(but be ready to devote an entire day to one game). If you want to sit around and have some beers and play a fun strategy game with some friends, buy risk, or risk 2210(Moon Risk), which is my favorite version of Risk. GOOD LUCK!",NA,"[3, 3]",1

Is there something that holds the paper taut at the top and at the bottom like the Hape Easel?,descriptive,The paper is wide enough for the large clips to hold the paper taut but it doesnt work for both sides width wise. I found that keeping the roll tight with a clip works so the roll of paper stays taut as well. The easel and the accessories allow for taut paper options. I have also found that the refill paper pads work well to. I have used tape on the dry erase side to adhere paper for a 2 year old and it comes off fine with no issues to the dry erase side.,NA,"[2, 2]",1

will  the 1370 make the 12 volt bulbs brighter compared to the mrc 1300?  both have the same wattage but i think different amps,yesno,"The 1370 can handle more of a load (more bulbs, locos, accessories, etc.) in terms of Amps than the 1300.  Since the units have the same output voltage, they should light a bulb to the same brightness, unless the 1300 is overloaded and not producing full voltage (test with voltmeter).",NA,"[2, 2]",1
will  the 1370 make the 12 volt bulbs brighter compared to the mrc 1300?  both have the same wattage but i think different amps,yesno,No it will not. The only way to brighten the bulb is to increase the bulb's wattage. By lowering the voltage to the bulb you can make the bulb dimmer but the bulb will only burn as bright as its rated wattage due to the resistance built into the bulb that creates the actual wattage illumination. Increasing the amps will only make the bulb burn out quicker due to the excessive heat created by the higher amps.,N,"[1, 2]",0

unifix versus snap cubes,descriptive,"Snap cubes will serve the same purpose as the unifix cubes in the area of counting,patterning, etc... The Unifix cubes,in my opinion, are better for small children and those with fine motor difficulties.  The snap cubes ""snap"" together.  They are a bit trickier for small fingers.  It also takes longer to snap, snap, snap them all.  The Unifix cubes do snap but it's very gently to the point where they almost stack instead.  They are also a softer plastic and the cubes are a bit larger.  The snap cubes have holes in their middle on all sides which can allow for lacing or stringing if you'd like to use them for additional fine motor skills.  The Unifix have no holes.  The Unifix cubes stay together well, but because they don't snap together tightly, they will only allow for so many to be stacked before tumbling. If you're stacking more than 20 cubes the unifix will be harder to keep together.   So it all depends on what your primary use for theses cubes are as to which will suit you better.",NA,"[6, 6]",1

does it tell what moves to make like a teacher,yesno,"It reminds you how the pieces move, and in the first phase of game play, you move according to which card you draw. If you pull a bishop card, for instance, you move the bishop if you can. Each card gives a reminder of how the piece moves, so it's reinforcing you as you go along. In the second phase, you get to draw three cards. In this phase, the game is forcing you to think: Is it better now to move my bishop, my pawn, or my queen? Eventually there's no need for the cards. You know how the pieces move and are strategizing on your own.It is a great teaching tool.",NA,"[7, 7]",1
does it tell what moves to make like a teacher,yesno,"You play with the cards down and when you flip it over, it tells you which piece to move and shows a diagram of how that piece moves. It is somewhat like a teacher, in that it shows how the pieces move. That is the focus, if the game is played with the cards, they will later figure out strategies. Here is a short video that depicts how it is played: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vn0bMld-K9wHave a wonderful day!",Y,"[6, 6]",1

How large are the pieces,descriptive,"They are fairly smaller than what I was imagining, but as far as playing with water, it's a good size for just pretend play.

does it have the holes for the pump system?,yesno,Yes it does. One year we ordered the one that comes with the pump for about $50.00 more and it was not worth it. The pump is very weak and useless. We find that using a skimmer and adding about a cup of chlorine every day or two keeps it clean. And we empty it about every week or two and refill it will clean water. We also keep it covered with the Intex solar cover. Hope this was helpful. :-D,NA,"[2, 2]",1
"Is a pump really necessary for this pool? Or could I get away with no pump, daily skimming, and a chlorine floater when the pool is not being used?",descriptive,Short term yes you can do without but water is hard to maintain quality over long time and no filter means no oxygen in the water so it goes bad faster. Small water tester should let you know when its time to start over.,NA,"[2, 2]",1
"Is a pump really necessary for this pool?

I had no problems at all without the pump skimmer.",NA,"[3, 3]",1
"Is a pump really necessary for this pool? Or could I get away with no pump, daily skimming, and a chlorine floater when the pool is not being used?",descriptive,"One year we had a pump.

Our dog even likes to play in it. Hope this was helpful. :-D",NA,"[3, 3]",1
"If I lean my arms over the side while in the pool will it push down and pour out the water, or will the top support some of my weight?",descriptive,"If you 'push down' it will pour out water. If you are sitting in a chair outside of the pool and rest your ankles on the side of the pool, it will dip down almost to the point of over flowing. You can rest your head on it while in the pool and let your body float without it overflowing. You can rest your arms on the sides while in the pool but not pressing down very hard. Make sure the ground is level!!",NA,"[2, 2]",1
Can you use this pool without the filter?  Does the inlet and outlet holes have caps?,descriptive,"You can use it without the filter and yes, there are solid caps for both, so as not to leak.   If you choose just to scoop out debrit and use a small chlorine floater when kids aren't in it, you should be fine.  Small amount if chlorine is highly recommend, otherwise it will get slimy.   This holds a good amount of water ...you most likely don't want to refill it more than once every 8 weeks if it keeps clean.  Enjoy!",NA,"[2, 2]",1
Can a 26 pound kid sit on it? My son loves riding on vehicles. Not sure if this Bruder is sturdy enough.,descriptive,"Not a good idea, big sticker on top of truck no sitting. However boys will be boys and children will ignore the sticker.  My son tries to sit on it all the time and it does support the weight, it's a sturdy truck. The only thing is that it will tilt back sometimes if your child will sit to far back.",NA,"[2, 2]",1
Does the truck come with a man,descriptive,"Wish it did, but little boys will definitely like this toy!! Actually women can do the work just as well as a man  can, so you are better off not asking if it comes with a man, they come with a lot of baggage!!",NA,"[0, 1]",0

My question is why aren't ethnic Baby Alives being sold by Amazon instead of third party sellers who are allowed to drive the price up?

Could I use this to stick just SOME pieces together???  I need to make a 110 piece puzzle much simpler to put together???,descriptive,"Hi Susan. I'm not 100% sure I'm following your question but I'll try to answer. Puzzle Presto comes as several adhesive pages. Out of the box they're 7.5 x 15 inches. (These sheets have a perforated division in the middle if you need to pull apart to make it 7.5 x 7.5) For smaller puzzles this is perfect. For example, my company makes 100-piece puzzles that are 11 x 15. (you can see one of the puzzles if you search for ""sensational sealife"" on amazon) When I was searching for a solution to frame samples I bought this product and found that one full sheet covered most of the job. I simply cut the 2nd sheet in half lengthwise and ""presto"". (wink)The sheet's aren't hard to cut so you really could use as much or as little as you need. The adhesive is pretty good though - I'm using these on our much larger puzzles as well and they keep them securely together. (meaning the adhesive is strong enough to handle a little weight) That said, you could pull a puzzle piece off after you've applied it but I wouldn't do it too many times or your puzzle pieces will suffer.I hope that helps!Mische,Top Bot @ Blue Dot Robot Games",NA,"[2, 2]",1

This is a two part valve, top-inflate, bottom ring-deflate. Remove the top cap, making sure the lower ring stays tight and place pump nozzle in (most pumps come with Boston valve adapters) or over if using shop vac hose. This is a one valve so pump pressure pushes it open and it reseals when pressure is removed so air does not come out. To deflate leave top cap in place and unscrew lower ring. One way valve is between the top cap and lower ring so there is no restriction during deflation. When inflating always double check that lower ring is tight or air can leak.",NA,"[2, 2]",1

Do they have any problems or frustrations using the pen?I would love to buy my son a Leapster2, but I'm concerned about the new positioning of the string on the pen. On the original Leapster, the pen is attached at the center. Now it's attached on the right side. This seems like it would be very annoying to a left-handed user.I know I have the option of buying the original Leapster; but it is my understanding that the new one has other upgrades in addition to the Learning Path feature.Thanks for reading this ... I would really appreciate any input.",descriptive,"Please, it's just a string!  Take a new piece of string a few inches long, tie a loop in both ends, slip out the original string (it's not permanently attached... it loosens very easily, no cuts needed), and loop your extension piece onto either end (exactly the same way the original string is looped around and threaded through the attachment point).  Be an example to your kids (like Catherine) by having a positive attitude about solving simple problems resourcefully.",NA,"[3, 5]",0

Thanks!",descriptive,"The Nintendo DS and the Leapfrog Leapster are two different platforms with mainly two different uses.  The Leapster is a learning system and all of the games are directed at developing a young childs mind through fun learning.   I have a 5 y/o going on 6 that loves her Leapster.  There are titles with characters that will keep your childs attention (i.e. Spongebob, Dora, Diego, Spiderman, etc) She has friends that have a DS but I feel she's getting much more out of the Leapster.   The Nintendo DS is a game unit with far more entertaining games than learning.  I think it would be better for you to look at the software rather than the platforms to make a wise decision on how your boys will use their systems and if it will satisfy your needs.

"Why is there such a disparity in price between this lazertag set and the $50 one from Hasbro? I am looking for a lazertag for my 11 year old son and I was wondering why one is $196 vs $50.  They each have 2 guns, etc.  Is one better for younger and the other is for anyone?",descriptive,"I have last year's model (the one listed now for $196+ on amazon) and it comes with three features that the newer model (2009 version) is not packaged with. The older model came with a sight, shot gun attachment (allows you to take off 3 lives for an accurate hit), and the attachment for the TV plug and play game (It has been played once by my boys). It looks like Hasbro is going to be selling the attachments separately. To give you an idea on cost, the older model sold last Christmas at Costco for around $70. and at Target for around $85.00.So, I don't know what the attachments will cost with the $50. model, but I assume it won't be the same, or they would have kept the older packaging. Regardless, the price of $196+ is way too high. I guess it is ""supply and demand."" Or just very greedy people. The toy is awesome.

Is the magnifier clear (focused)? Or is it rippled? How is the quality of what you are seeing?,descriptive,"The magnifiers I got in the mail are clear and in focus.  I haven't noticed any ripple effect so far.  The quality of these magnifiers are made of a very thin plastic that is flexible and scratch very easy if not handled with care.  Each magnifier came with there own plastic protective sleeve to keep magnifier in when not in use.  When compared to my glass magnifier I use at home, the glass magnifier wins.  Bear in mind, being these magnifiers are made of plastic and magnify at 3x. The whole intent of using them is for emergencies when you don't have reading glasses and need something to get by, which this product does for me. Hope this helped you.  Thanks for reading.",NA,"[3, 3]",1
Is the magnifier clear (focused)? Or is it rippled? How is the quality of what you are seeing?,descriptive,I would not purchase these again.

Which is better...Rollick or Reverse Charades?  They seem very similar in their descriptions.  Thanks!,descriptive,"Hi MrsMe, That's a good question.  The games look very similar, but from what I can tell there are some differences.  We love Rollick! because it encourages teams to work together and is not simply a ""charades"" game.   Watching teams collaborate together to act out the clues is the true ""magic"" of the game.   Rollick! has more cards/clues (playability) than Reverse Charades and offers additional play variations such as larger groups, head-to-head, and playing with younger children.  Also,  from what I've read on other reviews, Rollick! is a much higher quality product.  I hope that helps.",NA,"[6, 6]",1
Which is better...Rollick or Reverse Charades?  They seem very similar in their descriptions.  Thanks!,descriptive,"Well, I've played Rollick, and I've seen Reverse Charades.  They are essentially the same game.  We like Rollick better, as there area a LOT more words to play with, so you won't run out very quickly.  Also Rollick has a bunch of twists so it can be adapted for larger teams and or children.  You should have fun with either, but if you haven't purchased yet, I'd go with Rollick.

I've read that this game is best for larger groups so am wondering if our family of four will enjoy it. Any thoughts?,descriptive,"I think a small group could enjoy, but it's definitely ""rollicking fun"" with bigger groups.  We loved it for family reunions!  If the four of you are all on the same level of ability and knowledge base then it could still be fun.  We enjoyed including children and giving them ideas of what to act out.  If it's two adults and two younger kids, it could still be fun for each parent to work with a child, but it will be quite a different game than 5-6 per team jumping right in with crazy acting out.  Does that help at all?",NA,"[4, 4]",1

Would it work for a person to haul groceries 4 blocks while they are on a electric wheelchair and pull it home from store,descriptive,I believe you could do this with no problem. It is very sturdy & very easy to pull even when loaded. Wheels have good tread. Folding is easy but I have trouble keeping it upright to put cover over top.

Would it work for a person to haul groceries 4 blocks while they are on a electric wheelchair and pull it home from store,descriptive,Yes for your purpose it would work.

How long does it take to charge a 5300mah 7.4v lipo battery?,descriptive,"If charged at 5 Amps, it takes about an hour.  I read a guide on charging lipo batereis that says a safe rule of thumb is to charge for each 1000mah at 1 amp, so 5000mah would be safe to charge at 5 amps.

Are the Helium refillable???,descriptive,"Yes.  My initial helium fill kept the shark floating for over two weeks, to my surprise.

How high does it fly if you are in a very high ceilinged room??,descriptive,It can fly up to as high as the ceiling is. It's basically a helium filled balloon that would just fly away but it has a counter weight that mechanically moves along the underbelly of the balloon. The shifting of this weight (by the remote control) points the nose up or down. Then another control makes the tail fin flap back and forth and pushes the fish in the direction it's pointed. You can add or remove clay from the weight to allow it to go as high or low as you want.,NA,"[2, 2]",1

Can the game be played and fully enjoyed by only three players?,descriptive,"It can, but to get the full effect of the game, I would recommend playing with at least 4.  I played with 3 players the first time and I felt that the game didn't have the full charm and effect.

Can the game be played and fully enjoyed by only three players?,descriptive,"I agree with the previous two. Four or five are the ideal numbers for a Legacy campaign. I don't think I'll be giving too much away saying this, but there are 5 factions for each player to choose before every game whose advantages evolve as your game progresses. I would imagine that with three people, you would tend to stick to the same three factions since the other two would miss out on their bonuses early on and fall behind.

How long will a full nitro tank last?,descriptive,"It all depends on how rich you have the engine running.

However, once the bracelet is finished the true red comes back.  I have noticed that some of the ""copy cat"" generic bands do tends to get lighter and stay that way, even when they get off the loom.  Stick to the true Rainbow Loom bands.

Is this suitable for a 7-8 year old?,descriptive,"As a 7-Wonders expansion, the original base game is needed for this to be playable. If your 7-8 year old can play the original game, he can play this one--it does not add a lot of new rules, only new symbols that can be memorized after a couple times playing it through.If your question refers also to the 7 Wonders base game, I would say that it is a pretty difficult game to learn and teach. There is a lot to remember, and to understand the strategy would require a good understanding of the different ways to get points. If a 7-8 year is comfortable with a variety of strategy games like Settlers of Catan, Carcassonne, or Dominion, then he can learn this game. Very few people of any age are able to understand the game completely the first time playing it through, and some have trouble understanding even after multiple times of playing, so it just depends on how the child thinks.",NA,"[4, 4]",1
Does the Cities expansion require the Leaders expansion?,descriptive,"No. The Cities expansion will have a few more leaders to add to your leaders deck if you do have it, but the core of the Cities expansion (Black cards, debt tokens, diplomacy tokens and 8-player mode) functions completely fine without it.

My 7 year old kind of makes things up he doesn't remember when I'm not playing, but he still has a good time with his friends that are around his same age. If you're willing to play it a few times to help them learn the rules, then this game would be enjoyable to them by themselves. There's not much reading once you know the rules.

"I have 5 & 6 year old girls, do you think their age could handle this game? Could they play it without adult supervision?

Thanks!,descriptive,"I bought this last year for my then six year old son. It was definitely a solid buy and his then four-year-old brother was even able to play with a bit of direction. Honestly, he (the eldest) just likes the regular version better, so we only break this version out when his two younger brothers (now 5 and 4) want to jump in and play, too. Kids of Catan would probably be too boring for them, so I would go with Junior if you are certain that the full version would be too much.",NA,"[2, 2]",1

How do you justify the price of this lego set with MSRP of $34.99?,descriptive,"Really, it's not that bad.  For a set with 480 (small) pieces, $35 is an okay price.  Other LEGO sets have less pieces and cost more.  Also it is a LEGO CUSOO (or however you spell it) set.  So for a special set with 480 pieces?  It's ok.  It's about 7 cents per piece.  Most sets are about 10 or 13.",NA,"[5, 5]",1
How do you justify the price of this lego set with MSRP of $34.99?,descriptive,Well because MSRP stand for Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price so I guess the justification would be that since they (LEGO) are the manufacturer they can make that SUGGESTED price ANYTHING they want. Though I/everyone else here (including Amazon) don't have to personally justify anything to you on behalf of LEGO.If you were complaining about the ACUTAL selling price I would blame brand name toys and popularity and the fact that it just came out for the hiked up price.

In order to fit him, I had to tie-wrap the seat against the rear bar so that his legs could move the pedals as efficiently as possible.  Unfortunately, the steering wheel does not adjust, so he must lean far forward to steer the car.

Would the flaws in the factory-second dice potentially damage their randomness?,descriptive,"I'm not sure these are all ""factory seconds"" in the way that you're thinking. I suspect that a lot of these are tests of odd color combinations just to see what the finished product will look like. I've only gotten a couple pounds of dice this way, but almost universally they are FUGLY dice. I think they're combinations and patterns that were tested but didn't work out aesthetically and so were sold off in bulk. I could be wrong, but that's my guess for a large portion of the dice you get, which to me seem otherwise flawless.",NA,"[8, 8]",1
Would the flaws in the factory-second dice potentially damage their randomness?,descriptive,"That depends on how they are flawed. If they are tumbled less than normal they are sharper edged which actually improves randomness. However, some dice in the packs are tumbled too long which causes then to become too rounded. If the edges are too round it causes them to roll in a biased manner as they sides are always uneven. The only way to tell is to look closely at the dice or measure them with a set of calipers. Honestly,  just giving them a close look should be good enough unless you are playing for money.",NA,"[5, 5]",1

So what some third party opportunists do is they buy it from that other place, and sell it here at a marked up price for people who don't have a branch of that chain nearby (or people who don't know any better).

There is no threading to hold the screws in place, in fact there are only small depressions in the plastic to show where the screws go. The assembly is okay, but you need some muscle since there are no starting points for the screws. Any disassemble after the first installation would only weaken these points and cause loose fittings and probably a hazard. Unsure of box dimensions, no longer have it.

"What is the difference between ""Frustration-Free Packaging"" and ""Standard Packaging""?",descriptive,"Webwizardry, I wondered, too, so I Googled it and discovered that in the months since you posted your question, additional online info explaining this kind of packaging has appeared. Turns out that Frustration Free Packaging is an Amazon.com invention that replaces the original packaging with a simple carton. Pros: Less fiddly. Cons: (1) Buyers lose the original artwork, etc. of the original packaging. (2) Buyers take the risk of pieces, instructions, or other items that were sealed in the original packaging getting lost in transit, as it were, during the move from the original packaging to Frustration Free Packaging. For more info -- and a side-by-side comparison -- check out Amazon's YouTube video here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXcoM1W5kJ4. (While you view, also check out the comments, which include contributions from Amazon customers who've tried both Frustration Free Packaging and standard packaging.) From what I saw at YouTube, Frustration Free Packaging might really come in handy if one is ordering an item for, say, an elderly relative, or someone who has physical or cognitive challenges or is just plain super-strapped for time. For my own part, however, I'd rather spend extra time unwrapping something than risk having the item I ordered arrive with pieces missing. This is doubly true in the case of an item that is made in China, as the ""Pandemic Board Game"" is. As thousands of Amazon.com reviews indicate, many of us have learned the hard way that items manufactured in China quite often ship with promised components -- e.g. batteries, essential screws, assembly wrenches, instruction sheets, etc. -- missing; I personally see no need to tempt fate by enabling a packaging transfer that offers an additional opportunity for things to go missing! At any rate, Webwizardry, I know that I'm posting this answer long after you posted your question, but I hope that the game shopping that you were doing when you posted your question last year went well. : )",NA,"[3, 3]",1

"I see Zoomer is rated one of the best presents this year. Reviews are all over the place, should I get this for my 6yo GD?",yesno,"Yes BUT --- know the battery MUST BE FULLY CHARGED FIRST --- best done with switch OFF.   Clearly many have had problems coz of turning it on FIRST --- these batteries aren't meant to be fully discharged (can ruin them, actually).    That said ... Out of 2 I own, one Has A Charging Problem with it... And calling customer service is really a bad idea at the moment.   There Is GOOD REASON why this toy is selling out all over the place --- it IS a fantastic item, but it ALSO is Electronics, meaning it is Not Perfect, and IS prone to mechanical/electrical failure as are ALL SUCH SOPHISTICATED Devices !  Personally, I LOVE Robots, and have bought all 3 Models (Dalmation Black Spotted White, Female Dalmation Pink Spotted White, & Purple Body Male).  I had to buy them all Online --- still waiting for the Purple one.  So, I may be prejudiced, a bit.  I'm a retired NASA Rocket Scientist almost 70 years old, too...

Do you recommend this one for outside?,descriptive,"Definitely, this plane is better in the wind than the Champ due to having twin motors, and the Virtual Instructor technology, which automatically keeps it level in wind. You don't have to always fly in completely flat weather, it can handle some wind, nothing over around 5- 7 MPH, it weighs about as much as a deck nail though, so that's a no brainer.

how do I play,descriptive,With style.,NA,"[14, 15]",0
how do I play,descriptive,"Have you ever played Apples to Apples? This game is a much filthier, politically incorrect, and offensive version. One player selects a black card which has a question or a fill in the blank prompt, all other players submit a white card as a response, the player who selected the black card reads them aloud and selects a winning white card, the player who played that card gets to keep the black card to signify the point scored. There are some suggested house rules and optional rules to add to that.",NA,"[2, 2]",1
how do I play,descriptive,"It's fairly simple.  If you don't want to get the $25 set to start out with, getting an expansion pack or two would work for a shorter game.  But basically you deal out ten white cards to each person playing (I believe you have to have at least three people for the minimum), and then you decide who goes first.  Whomever goes first picks a black card up (keep in mind they're suppose to be face down so you don't know what you're getting until you pick it up), reads it and everyone but the person that read the card plays one of their white cards.  Then once all of the cards are together, the reader picks the best answer (in their opinion).My friends and I like to play for many rounds in a row, though with the $25 set it does come with a set of rules.",NA,"[2, 2]",1

"How does the ""threadless"" feature work? Is the fabric fusible & attached thermally by the machine?",descriptive,"This looks exactly like a felting machine, which uses special needles to tangle the layers of fabric together in that spot.

If this is a true felting machine, you can use other fabrics that are good for felting.",NA,"[9, 9]",1
"How does the ""threadless"" feature work? Is the fabric fusible & attached thermally by the machine?",descriptive,"No, the fabric is not fused nor attached thermally.

Is it red or pink?  I'm looking for a sewing machine for my son that is NOT pink.,descriptive,"With sufficient supervision, kids can be taught to use a real sewing machine that actually functions.  Let them work on their own with a real machine once they are older and have first learned to use the machine with you at their side.  These toy machines rarely function, are easily broken, and are more likely to turn kids away from sewing due to frustration.  Since real machines aren't marketed to appeal to children, gender bias is largely eliminated.  Also, for young kids, get some felt and let your kiddo design some stuffed animal shapes.  Felt can be easily sewn without seams: simply sandwich front, stuffing, and back and sew.  Kids can sew faces and buttons on, too.  My kids (my sons and my daughter) started these sorts of projects around the age of six and now are tweens who use a serger to make creative projects.",NA,"[5, 6]",0

What kind of battery does this need? Also what kind of prop fits it if I'm using it for an airplane?,descriptive,"I have used a 3s 1300 mah all the way up to a 3s 2200 mah battery with this motor and it performed admirably. My esc is a neewer 30a. The 20a esc will work but not for extended use. Almost any ground contact by the prop will surge the 20a with this motor and burn it out. The prop size really depends on the model. Being a 1000kv motor it does spin slower than a parkjet motor or the like. I have almost 15 hrs total flight time on this motor. I put. 9x6, 10x4 and a 11x5 on it. The 10x4 is where it got the best thrust without chewing through the battery quickly. The 9x6 gave me the best flight times and the 11x5 was awesome for 3d flight. It really depends on the weight of your aircraft. Hope this helps.",NA,"[3, 3]",1
What kind of battery does this need? Also what kind of prop fits it if I'm using it for an airplane?,descriptive,It depends on what type of flying you are going to do?

How much lift can it generate?  Can it fly in 10mph wind?  how high can it fly?,descriptive,"If by lift your asking how much extra weight it can carry, I think around 10-20g will work, but with reduced flight times.  Without added weight it can climb pretty fast.  How well it flies in wind is dependent on your skill, it will drift with the wind without user input.  A new pilot will need calm air to learn, but an experienced pilot could probably still fly well in 20+MPH winds.  It's small size means winds effect it less.  As for height, higher than you can see it to control it.  Range and height are at least 100 yards, but you will have a REAL hard time seeing ti to control it at that distance.",NA,"[8, 8]",1
How much lift can it generate?  Can it fly in 10mph wind?  how high can it fly?,descriptive,"Well It creates massive lift for it's size, which makes it a fast little drown. As for as fling in a 10 knot wind or higher, It makes it really hard to control and crashes result. Now that being said, if you want, you can fly in light winds all day without much worry. One thing though, it like all helicopters whether real or hobby sized, they all suffer from settling with power. which is descending into the copters own down wash. So to keep this from happening keep some side to side movement as you come down or forward and back. just don't come straight down from any height or you will find out what a rock looks like as your helicopter becomes one! happy Flying!!",NA,"[4, 4]",1

"could this work for my 5yr old grandson , or what one would be best",descriptive,"It is a bit complicated for a 5 year old.  It is difficult to control with the controller and takes lots of practice.  I practiced in my family room and thought I had it down pretty good.

"could this work for my 5yr old grandson , or what one would be best",descriptive,"The X4 series is pretty tough, but it may be a bit of a challenge for a typical 5-year-old, so you will probably want to train him with a free quadcopter simulator app that runs on Android or iPhone/iPad called ""QuadcopterFX"". The Hubsan X4 is less of a toy and more of a serious hobby quad, bearing all of the hazards of larger units, just on a smaller scale. For example, this quad, in stock trim, can fly faster than 35 MPH, which is fast enough to break windows even as light as it is. The motors are very small, but very powerful, and the propellers are razor sharp, so it is important to instruct him on safety, and attaching the blade guard is highly recommended. Also, be advised that the Lipo battery used on this, and all RC aircraft these days, requires a fair amount of care to prevent fire or contact burns if something should go wrong.All in all, you know your Grandson better than anyone, so you know whether or not he could handle this style of quad.If you want something a little simpler, you could look at the Air Hogs Helix Stunt (http://www.amazon.com/Hogs-Helix-Stunt-Quad-Copter/dp/B00DPGV4A6). This quadcopter employs ducted fan motors, which require no blade guards, and although the motors are still very powerful for their size, the propeller blades are blunt so are far less likely to injure little fingers. The high-density poly-foam construction makes the quad very light, so less likely to cause damage to delicate household items. Its battery is built-in, so unlike the Hubsan which features a removable battery, the Helix battery is not removable, meaning that the included charger plugs directly into the quad, leaving the battery less vulnerable to damage. The Helix is a great performer, easy to fly, fairly fast, does stunts, and costs a lot less than the Hubsan. My first RC helicopter is an old Air Hogs coaxial, which taught me the basics. That was more than six years ago, but the old Air Hog battery is STILL good as new, while the batteries for all my other helicopters have been replaced at least once, which tells me that the Air Hogs power management and charging system must be very well tuned for maximum battery life.Either way, I hope your very lucky grandson has a great time!",NA,"[2, 2]",1
"could this work for my 5yr old grandson , or what one would be best",descriptive,"I would say that the Hubsan 107C might be a better choice. I say this because this way you get the blade shroud to offer some protection from flying into walls and the sort.  if the camera isn't all that important, you might think about the Syma 107G. This can be purchased for about $20 rather than $60.  In any case, I do recommend Spare blades.  It's great to get them started at an early age, this really is a fun hobby.",NA,"[2, 2]",1

how do i correct for default drift and use the trim functions? I realize im spending 90% of the time just adjusting the auto drift while hovering.,descriptive,"Put the copter on a level surface. Your floor may not be level. Use a table & place the copter on a piece of wood or 1/8"" Balsa wood big enough for the copter to sit on. Place another piece of balsa big enough to sit on & cover all 4 props. Make sure the props are all the way down on the motor shafts. Place a small level on top of the Balsa sitting on the props. Now level the copter out in all directions by placing folded pieces of paper to the correct thickness needed in the area's needed to level the copter in all directions. Do this while everything is turned on. Once you have the Copter leveled, calibrate it with the controls by holding the throttle stick in the lower right hand corner & move the Aileron or bank control stick back & forth from right to left or left to right. keep moving it until you see the Copter lights flash indicating it's calibrated.

Will it be okay to run with graphite on the wheels too (they put it on all cars at check in) or do the wheels/axles need to be cleaned before using?,descriptive,"no this is a water based lube and if you mix with graphite you will cause ""binding"" with the powder. the company does have two other products that are graphite based if your rules require it. my son and I were able to avoid the graphite and were much happier with the zip lube and the polished axel nails.",NA,"[2, 2]",1
Will it be okay to run with graphite on the wheels too (they put it on all cars at check in) or do the wheels/axles need to be cleaned before using?,descriptive,wait until after they do check in and apply the graphite...this ZAP! lube acts in a manner similar to lithium grease and doesn't really need to adhere to the metal surface (axle) to be effective.  if you were to apply the ZAP! lube prior to check-in it would be more problematic since the graphite may not adhere to the surface of the axle...wouldn't do any harm ultimately but won't add any benefit either.  use this lube very lightly b/c over-application can occur and does build-up on the axle to the point where the wheels do not spin as freely.,NA,"[0, 1]",0

The photos show a set of 4 identical props. Are they actually a set of 2 clockwise props and 2 counter clockwise props?,descriptive,"Here's the correct answer.  CW and CCW prop nuts are all you need. I purchased them here on Amazon and put them on my DJI Phantom 2 Vision and they work fine. Whoever took the photo didn't know what they were doing and used four blades of the same direction. Here is a link to where you can buy them for $15.00. Copy and paste the text to the right here into your Amazon search window and you will see them. >>> DJI Phantom and Vision Replacement Prop Nuts High Quality Anodized Aluminum 2 RED 2 BLUE CW and CCW <<<. I purchased two red and two blue aluminum prop nuts. They look great also on the DJI and go with the DJI colors. The prop nuts only screw on one way so you can't mix them up. However, the carbon fiber blades simply fit over the motor shaft and have a fixed opening so they are very snug. One way to make sure you get the correct blades on the correct shafts is to replace one blade at a time. Two blades spin in the CW direction and the other two spin in the CCW direction. Both sets of blades are shaped differently also. Just hold one blade up against the one you are replacing and if the shape of the blades match, you have the correct blade for that shaft. If not, try another one. Another way to do it is to lay all for carbon blades out on a table next to each other. You will see then that the blades are shaped differently. Simply match the two CW and the CCW with each other and then replace them one at a time with the stock blades. You'd think the people who sell them on Amazon would explain this better but they don't. They figure you should know this. Hope this helps and if so, please leave a comment.  They do come from China so expect a couple of weeks or more before you get them. I'm unable to attach a photo of mine here but if you e-mail me at MidWestRC21@aol.com I will send you a photo of mine.",NA,"[3, 3]",1
My blades just arrived without the retaining nuts which means these are useless.

For anyone that's also played the Pathfinder ACG: how do the two compare?,descriptive,"I've got both, all current expansions for pathfinder, and most of LOTR. Basically, LOTR has far more direction in terms of story. The enemies you fight fit the theme of what you're doing. Each Level is sort of a puzzle to figure out a best approach to. It is devilishly hard sometimes.Pathfinder's unique twist is that you level up over time. Its more like a Lite version of a table top rpg. Thing's are pretty random, so the narration isn't quite as strong in any given level. It also isn't overly challenging yet. It is a great game though, very addictive to see your characters grow.What you would like more kind of depends on how much you're willing to give into the game and your gaming group. LOTR requires a lot of experimentation. You have to prepare your deck before each level. You will lose a lot, but there is a great sense of satisfaction when you overcome the challenge. I personally like it better when playing solo. If you want more than two people it is required to buy 2 base sets, it ""supports"" up to 4. Pathfinder is more of a joke around with friends, roll some dice, and not really needing to be that serious about it. The turns are faster, you get more instant reward. It's not quite as good solo, but with the character pack can support up to 6. LOTR has a lot more ways to help out a co op partner as well. You really need to plan together. In Pathfinder, it sort of depends on the characters you play as, but largely your turns do not effect each other as directly.",NA,"[8, 8]",1
For anyone that's also played the Pathfinder ACG: how do the two compare?,descriptive,"Pathfinder is shallow and repetitive, Lord of the Rings LCG is depth filled and tactical. The combinations that you can do in LOTR are nearly infinite. Pathfinder combos amount to no more than 'how many dice can I roll?' Lord of the Rings has persistent enemies that will sometimes last a few rounds and require careful handling, Pathfinder's enemies are one-offs. Teamwork in Lord of the Rings is complex and varied, teamwork in Pathfinder is ""I can add some dice to your roll..."" If you like simple, quick but repetitive fun then Pathfinder is your game. If you want a game that will challenge you at many levels but requires a pretty hefty investment in time to come to terms with, then Lord of the Rings will suit you. A group of us who play both games have come to the following conclusion: we are cancelling our Pathfinder subscriptions because the game just doesn't satisfy, we already own the entire LOTR LCG library and will continue playing and buying into that. Pathfinder will be forgotten, Lord of the Rings LCG is a masterpiece and we will be playing it for years to come.",NA,"[8, 14]",0
"what expansion should i buy next ,after playing the base set,for awhile",descriptive,"The expansions are released in cycles, of four or five packs each cycle.  Then, they release a ""deluxe"" expansion that adds new rules and ushers in the next expansion cycle.  The first expansion cycle is the Mirkwood cycle, the one with the green boxes.  Any from that set are good to start with.  The Hunt for Gollum, the Hills of the Emyn Muil, and Conflict at the Carrock are ones I enjoyed (although the last in that list is pretty challenging solo.)  If you want to buy a deluxe expansion, go for Khazad Dum.  That'll then allow you to buy any of the Moria cycle expansions (orange box).  They're VERY hard, however.",NA,"[3, 3]",1
"what expansion should i buy next ,after playing the base set,for awhile",descriptive,"If you can, go in order and do the Shadows of Mirkwood set. Some of those may be sold out, but try to play them in order. The first set of 6 decks utilize the evil cards from the core set. The later expansions use different shadow cards and you'll need to buy the appropriate Deluxe Expansion before you can play the regular expansions in that cycle.",NA,"[2, 2]",1
"what expansion should i buy next ,after playing the base set,for awhile",descriptive,"Really depends on what you want to play with.  It's probably better to go with the Kazad Dum expansion, along with the Adventure packs with its cycle, the Shadows of Mirkwood (The green boxes). The reason I suggest this, other than for 'going in order', is because Dwarves STILL have some of the best synergy.  Kazad Dum and the two Hobbit Expansions (on second thought, maybe you'll want to get the Hobbit ones...) are strongly focused on Dwarves.  If you want to have more of a focus with Humans from Rohan, go with the Dwarrowdelf cycle.  If you want more of a focus with Gondorians, try the new stuff from Heirs of Numenor and the Against the Shadow cycle.To figure out what cycle an Adventure pack belongs to, look on the back.",NA,"[1, 2]",0
"Aside from the core set, what other set(s) would I need to buy to play with 3 players and still have it be challenging?",descriptive,"None. In fact when you first start off if you have more than 2 players and just one core set, the game will be somewhat more challenging as you won't have the diversity of cards to build in two resource types to each player's deck. The game's difficulty scales automatically with the number of players, so you don't need to worry about it getting any less difficult by having multiples. All the other products in this line continue the story established in the core set, while also adding a few new cards per resource type each as well. Keep in mind the 60-card maximum deck size and each adventure pack becomes a rewarding exercise in what to keep and what to sideboard.",NA,"[2, 2]",1
"Aside from the core set, what other set(s) would I need to buy to play with 3 players and still have it be challenging?",descriptive,"The game scales up the challenge automatically when you add (or scales down when you remove) players. You turn over 1 Shadow Card per player each round, so while the third player brings more heroes and maybe more card synergies, he's also creating new problems and cycling through the shadow cards faster. On some missions you may find that you shuffle the shadow deck and go through it a second time, and that means getting tagged by some of the really awful Treachery cards after you've used up all your own cards to mitigate them. FFG recommends a second Core Set for more than 2 players, so they have a health tracker, but you can track their health on paper, that's what we've done. Your deckbuilding options for more than two players get a lot better once you have a few of the Adventure packs, but these are not necessary to ensure challenge. I think you'll find mission 2 and especially mission 3 of the core set plenty challenging. In fact, we didn't beat mission three until we had a few adventure packs which let us build more versatile decks.",NA,"[2, 2]",1
"Aside from the core set, what other set(s) would I need to buy to play with 3 players and still have it be challenging?",descriptive,"According to the FFG tutorial video, two core sets if enough to play with 4 players at the same time, so I imagine that it should be enough for three, the problem could be that there are no official rules for 3 players; there are only rules for 1, 2 and 4 player versions.",NA,"[2, 3]",0
Would this be playable for a 6 year old? Perhaps simplifying the game to accomodate younger players?,descriptive,"I would say yes, though your mileage may vary.  The core mechanics of the game are deciding what maneuver to perform, using the correct template to make that maneuver, and finally rolling dice to see if you can shoot/evade.  Special rules like evade, target lock, and focus modify the die rolls, and could probably be eliminated to simplify the game a bit.  I could see younger kids understanding the concepts of firing arcs and movement; though the finer points of tactics and anticipating your opponent's maneuvers might be lost on them.  You should definitely avoid the squad-building aspect, where you have X number of points to spend on pilots and upgrades.You should find a FLGS (friendly local gaming store) and ask the owner for a demo, or stop by and visit when they're doing a tournament or just open gaming.  I'm sure someone down there will be playing.  While you're there, buy something from them for their time.  :)",NA,"[2, 2]",1
Would this be playable for a 6 year old? Perhaps simplifying the game to accomodate younger players?,descriptive,"I play this with my 6 year old son.

I have one copy of the core set.  As I'm just getting into the game is it worth it to buy 2?  Thanks.,descriptive,"Hi!That depends on what sort of games you play. I currently have 2 because I love to play scenario-based games and use variable point games between 150 and 450 each. I bought two of them at once because I knew I wanted to have at least 6 t/f and 3 x-w. So is more cost effective to buy 2 core sets and the remaining ships separated (to get the unique pilots and habilities).Bottom-line is that you need at least 1 x-w and 1 t/f expansion as long as the core set if you want the cool pilots, so if you test the game and like it I would recommend you to get a copy of each first. But if you already have one of each and want to increase your fleet size I would totally recommend getting another core for price, extra dice and spares (plus the cool box).I hope it helped!May the force be with you!",NA,"[5, 5]",1
I have one copy of the core set.  As I'm just getting into the game is it worth it to buy 2?

But there are pieces you will use - the TIE's for example, will save you have to buy two of the handful of TIE expansions you'd want to pick up if playing a TIE swarm.  The X-Wing will serve as a rookie to bulk out a Rebel Squad.  The dice are essential - many attacks calling for four die, or many defenses adding to the die you need - and the three of each in a single box are simply not enough.  I think it's worth the outlay.",NA,"[4, 4]",1

I have one copy of the core set.  As I'm just getting into the game is it worth it to buy 2?  Thanks.,descriptive,"hello seth. That really depends on how much your into the game. In theory, you don't need 2 cores. You can play the game with what you dispose. OTher expansions do not only give you the possibility to fly other ships with different maneuver abilities and upgrade capacities, so you probably would want to get more of those. The reason why people get more than one core, besides getting extra dice is cause its the best bargain to get 3 ships. You'll find out how cheap those TIE fighters are, and if you'd like to fly 6 or more, getting extra cores is more economically feasible than just getting more of the separate expansion kits.

My husband can get it to bounce and we wonder if it just needs breaking in?,descriptive,"I purchased one for my 9 year old son last year. Initially he complained it was too stiff, but I encouraged him to stick with it. He quickly figured out he needed to hop and not just bounce.

The youngest is a small child and doesn't weigh much so he had a harder time with it at first, the older one could use it just fine. My younger one is almost 12 now and can jump on it really well now. I think the weight of the person has a lot to do with it, seems like about 60ish pounds is the magic number to make it ""easy,"" though it is possible to use with less effectiveness at a lower weight. Breaking in the springs doesn't hurt either though. I'd say just give it some time.",NA,"[2, 2]",1

The 8 year old is over the suggested weight limit, but she still enjoys riding this occasionally, but it is not her favorite toy.  The other two ride over and over.  In addition to the ride factor, this ramp is a hit with all the children for playing with their trucks and vehicles, balls and such on and while they play they are learning the physics concepts associated with force and motion.  The baby loves to walk up the ramp and slide down.  He has been playing with it since he was 8 months old and it is still the first play he heads when he enters the house.  We have been using it indoors as we have a long living room that allows both room for the ramp and room to shoot off the end.  We have a pillow against the wall in case they get that far, but they seldom do.  It is easy to set up and to put out of the way when we want the space for adult company without kids.  It would be equally fun, under a covered patio for all year play or just outside.  This is by far the best toy we have ever purchased.  I hope your family enjoys it as much as ours.

Are these durable enough for an adult to work out on?,descriptive,"Guess I'm the anomaly, but they aren't ideal for working out (depending on what type of workout you're doing and what surface is under the mat). They are definitely sturdy enough, yes, but comfortable, not exactly- if you have a very hard surface under them such as ceramic tile or concrete, the mats are going to be very firm and slightly uncomfortable if you're lying on your hip doing any sort of leg work on the floor. I speak from personal experience as I was just working out on them the past couple of days and found them to be quite hard for that purpose. If it's for a workout and you're on a very hard substrate (ie tile or concrete) I would recommend a mat with a softer padding.

Having said that, when I opened the box of the Leap Pad 2 Power I bought for my son the AC adaptor that comes with it says Input 100v - 240v and the leaflet that came with it lists the different currents for US/Canada, UK/Europe and Australia/NZ.

Also I highly recommend downloading all the books, videos and photo your child created onto your computer habitually. The things they create are amazing and often times if they are in the middle of creating a book, the battery goes out and it does not save their work all of the time if they are in the middle of something.

"Pedal Problems My son just got Smart Cycle for Christmas and the left pedal broke that same day!  When assembling it, I paid close attention to the directions to turn it counter-clockwise when putting it on and did so.  When the bolt came off initially, I noticed that it didn't go all the way on and no matter what I did, it wouldn't tighten.Any ideas?  My son's begging to play it...Thanks!",descriptive,"They have the left pedal bolt threading reversed when it should be the right one.  This causes the pedal bolts to ""unwind"" and loosen when pedaling forward.  I called the customer service for fisher price / mattel and the guy said that if I followed the directions, it would have been fine.  You don't need to be an engineer to know that a reverse-threaded left pedal bolt and a standard threaded right pedal bolt will cause both pedal bolts to unscrew under forward pedalling.  I guess they hired a managers kid to be their quality control tech and/or design engineer.  EASY FIX:  After you call customer support to have them resend the bolts and pedals (no charge), go to Lowes, Home Depot, Northern Tool, Ace, etc. and get a high strength epoxy designed for metal to metal.  I used Loctite Threadlocker 271 Red.  Put the bolts through the pedals all the way.  Then dab a little of the red glue on just the bolt threading.  It's kinda runny, so be careful.  Coat the outter 2/3 of the length of threading (from the tip inward 2/3 of the length, so that when you tighten it, there won't be any squeezed out to get on the plastic pedal).  Now, do one pedal at a time and make sure you adhere to the R or L on the bolt head.  While holding the outside of the pedal, keep the bolt head (non glued end) pushed in to fully expose the threading on the other end.  Mate the bolt threading to the female threading on the crank and SLOWLY turn it BACKWARD.  This backward pedalling motion will tighten the bolt (when, if correctly designed, should loosen them).  When you feel the threads engage, continue to turn until you have no more finger space left on the bolt head.  Then use a wide-head screwdriver to snug it completely.  Repeat this with the other side.  The glue sets in about 10 minutes, but I did it just after my son had gone to sleep to allow the full 10 hours for the glue to cure.  Be sure to spin the pedals a few minutes after you apply it to make sure none of the glue is holding them.  Hey Fisher Price, my resume's available if you want it!  ;-)",NA,"[7, 8]",0

Make sure you go audio to audio and video to video.  They are color coded like dvd players etc. (video is yellow and audio is white) If you purchase a video/audio patch cable the plugs are color coded the same way.  Hope that helps.

"steering problems!? Just put this together, as instructed, easy to assemble without problems; however the small clip inside the handle bars was a little difficult to clip in given the shortness of the wires, but did clip. The game seemed to be running great and I thought my child was just not adept at catching the letters so i tried steering for her only to realize the steering feature was not operating.  Has anyone else experienced this, and so, were you able to fix it.  I hate to have to return it and reassemble another it there is another solution.  And yes, I did pull off the handle bar once already an attempt to reclip the clip!  Thanks!",descriptive,"We had this same problem. Becki Robins is right. We fixed it last night and our 4 and 7 year old have been playing this morning for hours!The problem is a manufacturing issue. If you choose this route you do so at your own risk. Patience is the key. There is a small metal plate in the steering column that isn't attached well at all. It snaps off very easily. If you exchange the bike it will probably be a matter of time before it happens again. It's about 3/4 inch in size and looks like a fork with three teeth. We had to unscrew the section of the bike that houses the steering column ( which is what the directions refer to as the post). By chance we found that  the metal plate had fallen down into the long grey column  the directions refer to as the console; the one with all of the wires. We turned the bike upsidedown and after much doing, we were able to shake it out.It takes a minute to find the spot to reattach the plate. We used super glue from CVS; Becki's hubby used RV screws. So anyway the location: in the steering column, there are a bunch of rainbow wires attached to a rust colored circuit board. Remove this by taking out two small screws. The metal plate needs to be positioned so that the teeth will move along that circuit board. Just above the circuit board it a plastic piece that moves when the post is turned. This is where you glue the metal plate. Examine it carefully and you will probably see exactly where the plate broke from. You will see the slot/nest for the metal plate. The side with the two small holes needs to be placed flat  in the nest. Glue it in that spot making sure it is flat and let it dry well. Then just screw every thing back together. It works!Looking at the way this bike was made, everything else seems very sturdy, except for this crucial piece. If you choose to exchange the bike for another one it's only a matter of time before it breaks on the new one. Hope this helps. If so, please pay it forward.",NA,"[3, 3]",1

I'm probably a bit too late to help you since your post was a year ago, but in case someone else has the same problem I thought I'd post our solution.First, I don't recommend doing this unless 1) you know what you're doing and 2) you've weighed the chances of success against the possibility that you may void your warranty and will be stuck with a useless product you can't return, and have decided it's worth the risk.If you take the unit apart, inside the steering column you will find a small metal plate. This plate is what sends a message to the unit telling it that your child is steering the bike. Because of the way this product has been manufactured, it's possible for the plate to come loose. The plate has two small holes in it, and it has been attached with molten blobs of plastic that can easily break off. If you open your unit and find that this plate has come loose, that's your problem. You can reattach the plate easily with a pair of very small screws (slightly larger than the ones used in a pair of eyeglasses). You can get these kinds of screws from a hobby shop that sells RC equipment (my husband took some right off of one of his RC helicopters). Use the screws to mount the plate back in place. Once screwed in, it will stay there and will probably be even sturdier than it was just after manufacture.I hope this helps someone!",NA,"[2, 2]",1

smart cycle disfunction We just received a replacement from our first smart cycle that we bought about a year ago.  It would turn on and then the screen would just go wacky and turn off.

IE the career cards and the time it takes to get degreed vs taking the action route and getting a job as a model or sports star.  ?????,descriptive,"Honestly, we really like the game.  My kids have never, once chosen to skip education.  It does show them that it does take time and effort (and money) to get an education - that's the truth.  I've seen too many of my friends (in real life) skip the college route as kids because it was ""too hard"" and are now having to go back and do it with a family to support.  And we love the fact that the life points are so important - that money ISN'T everything.  (yes, there's some silly cards like, ""get a shoe deal.  Earn $500,000.""  But come on, its a game.  And  we've been able to laugh with our kids about that.  Being at least above-average, they know that's not reality.)We don't pay for everything with cash, but we do not carry debt on our credit cards, have car payments, etc.  We spend alot of time educating our children on responsible economics and I think this game helps.

How does this attach to a twin bed - Does a fitted sheet fit inside?,descriptive,You use your own fitted sheet.

I know how you feel, I watched pleo with a Dec 18 ship date for a couple weeks while I shopped around seeing if I could find one for less that was immediately available.

The instructions say to use an acrylic brush... Are there any affects if I use a natural bristle brush?,descriptive,"I used a natural brush at first, found it shed too much. It is best from my experience to use a basic acrylic brush.",NA,"[2, 2]",1
The instructions say to use an acrylic brush... Are there any affects if I use a natural bristle brush?,descriptive,"If your brush is not shedding, you can use anything, and I actually prefer natural bristle with Triple Thick.  Triple Thick is self-leveling, so you don't have streaks.  I love this stuff and have used it for years.  I've used foam brushes, natural brushes, and synthetic brushes, all with great results.  Be sure you use a brush dedicated to Triple Thick, and you can use it over and over again. My brush of choice is a for smallish jobs is a natural hair filbert.  You might need small or larger, depending upon the job.  They probably recommend acrylic because it is a little easier to clean.  When you are finished, soak your brush overnight in a mug of water before trying to clean it.  Then, rinse all the Triple Thick you can under a running faucet, use a little liquid soap and work it well into the bristles including as close to the ferrule as possible, rinse thoroughly, shake or wipe dry, and reform the bristles with your fingers.  As soon as it is dry, it's ready to be used again. Hope this helps.  Warning:  I live in the south and find that if I use Triple Thick in very hot or humid weather, it takes forever to dry and harden.  I limit my use of it during the hottest months.  Don't forget to cover your project while it is drying - a cardboard box works fine - to keep the finish smooth and free from small flying insects, dust, and anything else that may be airborne.",NA,"[3, 3]",1

"Directions makes no sense The directions to this game makes no sense.

So how does the judge know which player picked which card if the cards were mixed?",descriptive,The judge chooses the card he thinks fits best and announces it to all players.

So how does the judge know which player picked which card if the cards were mixed?",descriptive,"Each player gets 5 cards face down.  Whosever turn it is to be ""judge"" picks  (I think) a red card and reads it to everybody.  Everybody has to choose one of their (I think) green cards and submits it to the ""judge"" face down. (I might be getting the card colors mixed up - haven't played in awhile).  Anyway, each player chooses a card out of his 5 cards that he thinks best ""matches"" the card the ""judge"" read out.  He chooses the card he thinks the ""judge"" would select, based on his knowledge or lack of knowledge of the person.  The ""judge"" mixes the cards up face down so he doesn't know who submitted which card.  Then, he turns them over and one by one reads the cards and has to select the card he thinks best matches his card - or the card he thinks is the funniest, etc.  Anyway, he gets to choose.  Whomoever put the winning (chosen) green card down, gets to keep the red card.  Whomever collects the most red winning cards at the end wins.  Once you get the hang of the rules, it's easy and it's pretty funny.  The cards sometimes (usually) have very little to do with each other - and you have to stretch your mind to try to find a connection.  For instance, the ""judge"" might pick out a card that says ""Dracula"".  I might be holding the following 5 cards:  James Dean, The Worlds Fair, Italian Bread, Rocking Chair and Fried Green Onions.  I have to select out of my 5 cards the one I think would best match up with ""Dracula"".  The person next to me might have the following five cards:  Communism, Ketchup, the Internal Revenue Service, Marilyn Manson, Piano Lessons.  Depending on the cards the players have, they have to each throw out their one most interesting or wierd or similar card they think the ""judge"" would select.  After the round, the next person gets to be the ""judge"" and you go around the table until you're out of cards or exhausted or whatever.  We usually play until somebody has collected 5 red cards.  This is a game with a lot of surprises. A lot of discussions ensue.  It's a thinking game or, you can just be drunk when you're playing it.  Depending on who you're playing with, you could have a blast.",NA,"[8, 9]",0

"What is the difference between the standard and this ""Party Box"" version? Thanks!",descriptive,"There are two formats of the ""Party Box"" - standard packaging, and frustration-free packaging. The standard packaging contains 441 red cards and 63 double-word green cards, and measures 10.5""x10.5""x1.5"". The frustration-free package contains 438 red cards and 62 double-word green cards, and measures 6""x3.75""x2.5"". The double-word green cards change the game play slightly: the judge chooses which word to use, or you can play the ""2 for 1"" variation in which ""each player selects the Red Apple card from their hand that is best described by BOTH words on the Green Apple card"". Both Party Boxes have the label ""Family"" in the lower left corner to indicate it is a family category game. This should not be confused with the Family Edition.The Family Edition is also labeled ""Party Box"" and, just by looking at the picture, it is impossible to distinguish this from the standard packaging Party Box. The price, and the words ""Family Edition"" in the title are the only clues that this is actually a different product. The Family Edition contains 756 red cards and 252 green cards, and measures 12""x12""x4"". It is a slightly bigger box than the standard packaging of the Party Box, but it is hard to tell this from the pictures, because they have the same shape. To be sure of which one you are getting, look in the description: in the Family Edition you will see ""Includes over 1,000 cards"", as compared to ""Includes over 500 cards"" in either format of the Party Box. Beware of the misleading advertisement on the Family Edition product page that says ""There is a newer model of this item"", with a link to the Party Box page. This fooled me into thinking that the standard packaging of the Party Box is the same thing as the Family Edition, just a newer version. This is NOT the case! The Party Box is half the price, but contains less than half the cards. The reduction of cards hits the hardest in the green card supply, with a mere 62 in the frustration-free Party Box and 63 in the standard packaging Party Box. The Party Box green cards have two words each and the Family Edition green cards have one word each, but there are four times as many. So if you really want to play the ""2 for 1"" variation with the Family Edition, you can draw two green cards per turn and STILL have more than twice as many turns as with the Party Box.The rules sheet for the Party Box is simplified and lacks detail. It does not contain the chart of how many cards are needed to win for different numbers of players, as there is in the Family Edition rules sheet.Physically, the standard packaging Party Box is very close to the Family Edition, only a couple of inches smaller but the same shape. The frustration-free packaging is more compact and portable. You could throw the frustration-free box in a purse or backpack to take with you on the go. If the box is jostled around or turned upside down, the cards will stay secure in the frustration-free packaging Party Box, but will get shaken around and fall out of their tray in either the standard packaging Party Box or the Family Edition. If portability is your priority, compare the frustration-free Party Box to the ""Apples to Apples To Go"" portable version, with 270 red cards and 90 single-word green cards, measuring 8""x8""x2"", and featuring a built-in carrying case with magnetic closure.Conclusion: The Party Box is a cheaper version, what I would call Apples to Apples ""lite"". It is roughly half the price of the Family Edition, and contains less than half of the cards. It is a good budget option if you don't anticipate needing 1,000+ cards. The frustration-free packaging is compact and decently portable, so it may be a good budget alternative to the ""Apples to Apples To Go"" travel edition. Although the Party Box is being advertised as an updated model of the Family Edition, it is really a downgraded version. The packaging is so similar that it is very misleading. Don't be fooled.",NA,"[2, 2]",1

There are three Napoletane decks produced by Modiano: Napoletane 97-25 (3 1/2"" x 2""), Napoletane 97-31 (3 1/2"" x 2""), and Napoletane 97-38 (3 1/4"" x 2"") (sizes given on the Modiano website). Otherwise, the only significant difference appears to be the back design.",NA,"[2, 2]",1

These cards are a ""standard"" deck of 40 cards (Ace through 7, Knave, Knight & King, 4 suits) as used in the card game Scopa and other games popular in Italy. They are smaller than a regular deck of 52 playing cards (such as used in poker). These are about 3 1/4"" x 2"", regular poker sized cards are about 3 1/2"" by 2 1/2"". The numbers could relate to the size, or the card stock used.",NA,"[0, 1]",0

How fast can this Falcon do the Kessel Run? Any improvements?,descriptive,"The Kessel Run was one of the most heavily used smuggling routes in the Galactic Empire. Han Solo claimed that his Millennium Falcon ""made the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs"". A parsec is a unit of distance, not time. Solo was not referring directly to his ship's speed when he made this claim. Instead, he was referring to the shorter route he was able to travel by skirting the nearby Maw black hole cluster, thus making the run in under the standard distance. By moving closer to the black holes, Solo managed to cut the distance down to about 11.5 parsecs. (Source: http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Kessel_Run)",NA,"[6, 6]",1

Hi are these blocks fun for a six year old or would he be too big for him?,descriptive,"Many of the blocks in this set are actually pretty small (1-2 inches), so kids can make decently intricate buildings with them. I will say that because the blocks have no way of locking together, they are very prone to collapsing from accidental bumps or dropped pieces. My three year old really enjoys them, but more often than not he wrecks his structure before he's finished.

Can 2 tracksets be connected to one another to create 1 large track?,descriptive,"I wouldn't recommend it. The base has the ""motor"" and basically, it pushes the cars through so they loop endlessly. You have to manually hold the switch, which raises up the bottom part of the loop, allowing the car to squeeze under and circle around the rest of the track - ultimately arriving back in the loop (providing it doesn't crash into the other car while on the track). Some heavier cars just barely make it around the track and into the loop. Adding additional track would definitely mean the motor couldn't power them across the entire circuit and back to the main loop. Also, the track portion curves and has special supports to keep it in place, I am not sure that track could be added to it without causing it to warp.  It really does have a rather large footprint, it takes up the entire coffee table we have it on - hanging off the sides slightly.",NA,"[2, 2]",1

The tree house is only 30 inches tall, so if the baby is taller than 30 inches (usually about a year old), he/she would not be able to stand inside without touching the top.

I had to connect to the top RIGHT.  Regardless of the location, the pin is labeled ""AO"".Works pretty good.  It seems to have been designed specifically for the HERO 3+.

When I first got it and opened it up, I found it difficult to fly but after a couple of sessions you get the hang of it and before you know it, it's really easy to fly. But I do recommend you buy an extra kit of propellers because you do tend to break them quite quickly on your first couple of tries.

are the letters interchangeable?,yesno,"This set comes with one of each of the lower-case letters, plus an extra ""d"" , ""e"" , and ""m.""  Any letter can be placed in any of the 3 slots.  There are different settings, controlled by the orange (or blue) slider on the bottom.  The settings control what is done when letters are placed in the slots.  Letter Hunt (""Load a Letter"" on my machine) results in the machine saying the letter name when placing it in any slot and then saying some phrase that uses the letter sound.  Word Builder asks you to put in 3 letters to make a word.  As you put in each letter, it says the letter name, then waits until you have all 3 letters before it sounds them out.  If you put in something that does not make a word (like ""elw""), it will sound it out, make a ""doing!"" sound, then say, ""That sounds great!""  or ""Cool Sound,"" etc.  If you make a word, it will sound it out then say the word.  Word Hunt asks for the letters that spell something (""Let's hunt for the letters that spell the word ""gem"" ""g"" ""e"" ""m"" ""gem"" ... ""gem"" starts with the letter ""g"").  If you ignore which letters it asks for and put in something else, it will say the letter name you put in, it's sound, then say what letter it is looking for for that spot.  Short answer is, yes, the letters are interchangeable.  This unit even lets you put in the upper-case letters from the LeapFrog Fridge Phonics Magnetic Alphabet Set, if you have it (and vice-versa).",Y,"[0, 1]",0

Item no. not on Bachmann web site.",descriptive,"What I have is an N scale locomotive and tender. It's approximately 4 ¾"" long X 1"" high X ¾"" wide. I don't see in the item description where it gives ""1:24"" as the size.

This engine runs strong and is pulling six cars, but it would probably pull more. It has no headlight and it runs a little rough but doesn't stall out and just keeps going. It hasn't jumped the tracks on tight turns like some of my more expensive Locomotives seem to do. For the price I am very satisfied.Are you looking at the same Locomotive I have?

"how to make normal darts fire from the longshot ( you heard me ) all you have to do is get a bunch of nerf micro darts (preferalby the whistelers) and remove the tips.

But that's scraping the bottom of the sound barrel now.What you really want for pulling sound from a wall, is called a transducer.  Something you mount or hold directly against the concrete wall, that amplifies the HEAVILY-dampened accoustic-range vibrations coming through the concrete.  You would also need an otherwise very quiet environment, and probably some very very good EQ to filter out everything outside the human vocal range, because you're going to be amplifying it a whole hell of a lot.For that problem, this tool is ill-suited.  This is just a glorified bird listener, maybe snatch some convos from across the parking lot.  And you'd never use a parabolic collector for acoustic transduction, that would just be silly.",NA,"[3, 3]",1

What are the dinosaurs made from?,descriptive,"Staight from the company, these are made from PVC and polyethylene plastic. They claim they are phthalate free and BPA free. Many reviews reported an off-gassing smells out of the box. If these have a bad smell then something in the plastic is breaking down and releasing chemicals. I'm sorry to say, but if these are made with PVC then they are NOT SAFE. Maybe by US standards but I highly doubt they would pass in Europe. They may have been able to make the PVC without phthalates but they must have had to find a suitable plasticizer replacement. This replacement just isn't a known toxin YET. The same goes for BPA. A replacement has been found that is just as toxic so companies can use the replacement and label the product BPA free. Just remember where plastic comes from...petroleum. There is no getting around it. Plus, polyethylene terephthalate or PET (if that is the one they use) can leach a toxic heavy metal called antimony. Most problems occur with plastic as it ages which doesn't take long. So, do your homework and don't take the companies word for it! Stick with wood toys with water based paint.",NA,"[3, 3]",1

do they contain formamide ingredient?,yesno,"I believe all foam play mats contain formamide, but with different amount.

"I'm curious whether all the cards are ""family-friendly"" (~PG rated)?",descriptive,"I don't remember anything that wouldn't make it family-friendly. It isn't like Cards Against Humanity, at all. Only in the fact that you are holding cards in your hand. They have rules on them, like you can't say ""you"" ""your"" or ""You're"" for the rest of the game or you are out. Another one was tell everyone to play rocks paper scissors, and then on the card it would say whoever put up (lets say rocks) loses. Other ones might say ""You next turn everyone loses...yes...really, you all lose"" , then suddenly everyone is trying to get you out so they all don't lose.

"I have 3 kids, ages 12, 10, and 7. Can they play this game and have fun, or is it the kind of thing that only adults get?",descriptive,"My kids are 9 and 11 and love the game.  As long as a kid can read the card, they'll enjoy it (many of the cards involve a ""secret"", so it's not something that another player can help a younger non-reader with).",NA,"[3, 3]",1
how do you play?,descriptive,"Well, deal out a couple of cards to each person.  Then each reads the cards, the most 'randomness' person goes first.  There are cards that you can play to change the rules (like you can not say a certain word like you, your or yours - if you do you lose.)  There are cards that you can play on other people and they will lose if htey cna not get rid of them by the next turn. There is a card you cna play that will make everyone lose (out of spite).  It's jsut totally random.  We had kids who could barely read (other kids were helping them with words they didn't know) who figured it out.  If anyone comes up to the table as the game is in play, you hand then a couple of cards and they're in the game.  We didn't really tell anyone how to play, they just figured it out by reading the cards.  There were LOTS of laughs and it was a big hit with my whacky family (except my sister who likes rules and order.)",NA,"[8, 8]",1
how do you play?,descriptive,"Each player is dealt cards.  The goal is to win, or not to lose.  The rules on each card tell you how to play.  An example of a card someone may have could be something like: ""Presents or No Presents"" - each player has to choose.  After all have chosen, the rest of the card is read.  The presents may be kittens in which case all who chose No Presents lose and are out.  Or, the rest of the card may have something bad, meaning those who chose Presents are out.",NA,"[7, 8]",0
how do you play?,descriptive,"There's no simple way to answer that question. Gameplay involves dealing everyone 2 cards, and then at the start of each turn the player draws an additional card and then plays 1 card. ""Playing"" a card entails doing exactly what the card says. Each card will have a rule you can put into play that everyone must follow, an attack on a specific player, a power or ability you can use, and many other crazy rules. You just have to get it and play it--trust me, it's more than worth the price :-)",NA,"[4, 4]",1
how do you play?,descriptive,"All directions are on the cards. You draw and play cards each turn. Play passing between players, like most card games. It's astoundingly simple.",NA,"[1, 2]",0

are there any examples of the game or the questions we can look at before buying?,descriptive,"Not that I've seen, but they're all fairly random anyway with lots of insta-wins and insta-loses, so they wouldn't do you much good even if you saw them. For instance, playing attack penguins against another player, allowing you to steal one of their cards. Or arbitrarily declaring that you receive 8 points and that having 15 points is a new win condition. Or if several people lose in one turn, declaring that you all lost because of a player you pick as the ""noob"", so only that one person loses and everyone else is back in. Or playing a dragon against another player, which causes them to lose if they can't get rid of it before the end of their turn. Or forcing everyone to scream in fear about zombies before they draw a card. Or declaring that anyone who says, ""I"", ""me"", or ""my"" loses instantly. The Chaos Pack that comes with it had some funny twists, such as allowing anyone who gained points (points are entirely arbitrary) to point at another player and make them lose instantly, so long as that other player wasn't singing.One low point was that some of the cards were repeated, except that the lose condition was changed. In a game I played yesterday, three of us thought we had an identical card telling us to have each player use their fingers to display a number from 1-5, but we discovered that each of us had a different lose condition written on the card (e.g. anyone picking odd loses, anyone picking even loses, if the total is prime everyone else loses). It means that people who have played it before have no real advantage, but it's still a bit uncreative to have something like that repeated several times (there are similar cards for rock, paper, scissors and other such things, where anyone picking X instantly loses).",NA,"[3, 4]",0

whats the age range of these playground?,descriptive,"Just my thoughts on it is that I feel that it's a safe play area for most children from the age of 2 up to 8 or 9 years old.

could a four year old play this,yesno,"My four year old now five year old could play with this and has had lots of fun. He has had a couple of neighbor kids over and some seemed to struggle with holding it while reloading.  Other kids had no issues at all.  My 3 yo. struggles with the reload concept so just runs around pulling the trigger (it makes a sound until it runs out of shots.) My 2 yr. old cannot do it at all but has discovered that the guns are sort of heavy and are good things to bash her brothers with (by good, I mean likely to get the desired whining reaction.)  Dad and the 4/5 yr. old have had tons of fun playing against eachother.  It is not an every day toy at this point but it makes an appearance about 2-3 times a month for a couple of hours at a time. So, all and all, this is a great little toy. Batteries seem to last for ages and they have been dropped, whacked, etc. and they keep on going. I would purchase them again.

for beginers?,descriptive,"This plane is so shabby in construction that it would take a true expert to fly. I've gotten fairly good since I started the hobby and I can say that this plane is a total waste of money whether you are a beginner or an expert. It is totally unstable and will break with the touch of a feather. This is the worst possible plane for a beginner. I would recommend either the Champ, or even easier, the Ember 2 RTF (ready to fly). I know this plane looks appealing people trying out a new hobby because everything is there and the price is incredible. If you're not serious about getting into the hobby, try some flight simulators first....there are good app for free that give you a good idea of what it's like to fly without crashing your plane. It's also excellent practice. I spent about 3 hours on that simulator before attempting to launch my first plane (the champ). On Google play it's called ""Absolute RC Simulator"" it's free. It's also on iPhone for free. Return this plane now if you ordered it already. They say you get what you pay for. I can promise you, you will get nothing but disappointment.

Is this box better then the original to get as a first time Dominion player or should I get the original first and add this?,descriptive,"I love the Intrigue set...but I would still recommend starting with the base game. There's still quite a lot of variety to be had without expansions. Intrigue awards the ""choose"" mechanic which isn't in the base game, as well as cards that are both a victory card AND something else. Intrigue is still worth it...but I still have to recommend base game first. Now, that said, what I REALLY recommend is the ""Big Box"" available here on Amazon. It has the base game plus two expansions. It is completely worth it!",NA,"[3, 3]",1
Is this box better then the original to get as a first time Dominion player or should I get the original first and add this?,descriptive,"I'd still suggest getting the original first. It is simpler, the cards mostly do one thing, and it covers the basic ideas of the game. Intrigue has a lot of cards that give you choices, it has more variety and mixes the basic cards together, which slows new players down a little. We also play with a lot of people who aren't hardcore gamers.I like having both though as sometimes we play with 5 and 6 people. We ended up with those two and Prosperity and Hinterlands because these expansions don't add many new rules, but give lots of options.

"How does one decide between original W&W, Part W&W, &Family W&W?",descriptive,"W&W; Family is the best edition when playing with kids.  The questions make sense to a 5 year old, the game does not use poker chips (there is no gambling), and the rules are the most simple of all three editions.The original W&W; is a little more complicated than the other editions.  It incorporates the excitement of Vegas by including a felt mat that has different payout odds for each of the guesses.  The questions in this edition are the most academic of the three options.  It was designed as a party game for adults.  None of the content is inappropriate for kids, but some of the questions are about things which they will not have heard of (like Michelangelo's David sculpture, or Martin Luther King).W&W; Party is a combination of the other two editions.  The rules are very simple (like the Family edition), but you are allowed to bet your poker chips on the last question.   The questions are lighter than the original W&W; (some of them are very silly), but they are not geared for kids.  This edition was designed to play with all three generations over the holidays.  It was designed to get people interacting and having fun as quickly as possible.You can play any of these editions in teams.  In fact, I think Wits & Wagers is MOST fun when played in teams.  So any of these editions can be played with 20+ people.  I hope this helps!Dominic CrapuchettesDesigner of Wits & Wagers and Say Anything",NA,"[14, 14]",1
"How does one decide between original W&W, Part W&W, &Family W&W?",descriptive,"Original is for 3-7 players, Party is 4-20 players, and Family is 3-10 players like original but easier questions and scoring is easier.

"How does one decide between original W&W, Part W&W, &Family W&W?",descriptive,"W&W; Family has the simplest rules and the questions that are best for kids.

Family has things like ""How many Disney Princesses are there?""Family also has no betting, W&W; has it the whole time (very complex betting for a simple game), Party just has betting in the last round. Since it is cheaper and I think it works fine with the Family edition, and it works great for adults too, I'd get that version, and I would say the original W&W; is the most overly complex and is the last one to get, it's really only for W&W; addicts.",NA,"[6, 6]",1
"How does one decide between original W&W, Part W&W, &Family W&W?",descriptive,"I am not familiar with the party version, therefore, cannot address that part.  As for the original or family version, we have both and find the kinds of questions very similar.  There is nothing more ""adult"" or offensive in the original than in the family.  We enjoy scoring with the family version even when playing the original as the original takes a bit more time to score when passing out chips according to the wagers.  In the family version, there are two wooden figures of each color--a larger one worth 2 points and a smaller worth one point--which are placed on the dry erase cards to make wagers.  There is a larger dry erase board with circles under each color which are colored in to keep the score.

"Family of 3 - daughter is a bright 11 year old. Will she find ""family"" too babyish? Which version should we get?",descriptive,"I don't think it's babyish.

I would say 8-14 is probably a good age range.  As a parent, I really enjoy it and don't always have the right answer!  I agree with Michael C., watch ""Table Top"" with Will Wheaton, they play a whole round and you can get a feel for the questions.  The Dice Tower has a differing opinion but I find the Dice Tower fellas are so immersed in serious gaming that when they think a game is too simple, I usually really enjoy it as a family game.  This was one of our favorites over the summer, playing two adults, and two children, 8 and 10.

forgive the likely stupid question...but does it tell you exactly what to buy as far as the lumber?,descriptive,"Actually a very good question. No, the Amazon Prime vendor does not tell you, but a different listing (not prime) had it laid out in more detail. This gave me an opportunity to get some lumber education. You will want to use Cedar.  The legs are 4""x4""x8'. The beam is either a 4""x6""x10', or 2-2""x6""x10' pieces bolted together (I used the bolts that are included and a tube of commercial grade liquid nail). The things you'll have to settle on are how long you really want the beam. It could be a little longer or shorter.  My lumber guy only had 12' so I cut some off. If you use 2""x6"" material, you will want to add a piece to fill the bracket from side to side. The other thing you need to decide before you buy lumber is ""rough"" or ""smooth."" Rough cedar is larger than smooth cedar. Best thing you can do is go to a good lumber yard and give them the exact inside dimensions of your brackets, or even wait and take one in with you, and have them explain the dimensional difference between rough and smooth so you get the right thing the first try.

How are legs attached?  I saw AG dolls have elastic band attaching them. our gen has plastic ball and joint and legs broke off easily.,descriptive,"I really don't know.  Bought it for my great (ought to be grand, but it skips to great for aunts) niece, and couldn't get it from her hands for closer inspection.   I know that with my own Alexander dolls, the hard-bodies (Cissy, & dolls of the world & other 8"" hard-bodied dolls) were held by heavy elastic bands; the soft-bodied dolls (Elise, Little Genius) were the ball-and-socket type.  This doll is softer than Cissy, but felt more rigid than Elise.   I can say that this was learned due to curious hands, not at all fault of the dolls.  I must also admit, when my uncle became a quadriplegic due to polio, Elise frequently ""lost"" arm or leg, as Uncle lost use of the appendages, and the joints never did tear.  In fact, the dolls lived to be played with rather roughly by my daughter, and even survived that.  Should the tote in which they were packed before my last move ever be found, they will become friends for the same niece.    The Alexander doll company has a web site, & they could probably answer your question; I believe they had a place for writing questions, as well as a phone number.  Be warned, however:  Amazon's prices were considerably less than direct from the company (that really surprised me).   Hope this was helpful.  Feel free to ask anything else I may be able to help with.  Those dolls were my best friends as a young child.      You may enjoy knowing this:Being 62 now, I was at the peak of doll-playing age (7) when Barbie first came out.  In the beginning, I begged & begged for a Barbie, like all the other girls; sadly, Mom said ""no"" time & time again, saying that they would not last as well as the Alexander dolls.  I was so angry, disappointed, & exacerbated!  But my anger, after only a few months, turned to delight!  Almost every friend who had a Barbie had suffered a dolly death: the Barbie.  While their parents replaced the broken doll, usually with another Barbie, they still grieved for their original friend.  At that time, I promised myself that my own daughter would be given Alexander dolls only, which she was; however, at that time they were extremely hard to find, being rationed & lotteries to better stores only.  While, accordingly, way out of my budget, I did the travel necessary to search them out so Teri could have them.     And, when she saw her own friends' dolls differ similar fates as suffered by my friends' dolls, she made the same promise for her own future child.",NA,"[0, 1]",0

"Do the explorer games we already own work on the leap pad? From what I've read, all the leapster explorer game cartridges are interchangeable with the leappad.

"Kindle Fire instead of LeapPad for 5 1/2 year old? LeapFrog LeapPad Explorer Learning Tablet (Pink)I'm in the market for a tablet for my 5 1/2 year old and 2 year old-both of whom are whizzes with my iPad 2.  I'm looking at the Kindle Fire and the almost endless apps/books/movies/songs, rechargeable battery and price of only $199. It sure seems like a much better value than the LeapPad.  Has anyone purchased the Kindle Fire for use by a child?  How does it compare to an iPad 2?  Thanks!",descriptive,"My wife and I are very happy with the K Fire. I installed 2 educational children apps ""Kids Math"" and ""Kids Match'em"", a calculator and Mapquest; they all work excellent. There are thousands of android apps, all Dr. Seuss animated books and of course e-books.  This device offers the educational piece, the entertainment, netflix, youtube, pandora, silk browser, etc. and of course amazon.  My wife got one of the roocase covers which would give plenty of protection to the device in case of a drop. I would recommend this device to a kid 5 or 6 and older; perhaps younger children with supervision. The WiFi connection can be easily disconnected so that younger children don't access internet or buy apps accidentally.When you consider the price of the Leapfrogs cartridges and apps (2 cartridges, 2 e-books and 2 sets of rechargeable batteries) you are at the price of the K Fire. The Fire will grow with your child for years to come; the Leappad will get outgrown sooner or later; however both devices the LeapPad and the Explorer get played frequently by our 4 and 6 year olds and are basically worry free.  They both are great devices and of course the K Fire was not designed to be toy but can be used by children with the proper protection (cover, screen protector, stylus).",NA,"[23, 24]",0

She's played with it for a couple of days and loves it.  She has had exposure to the Leapster 2 (her gateway drug), our IPhones and then the IPad 2.  She is very accustomed to navigating on the Iphones and IPad.  After giving her the Fire and downloading several apps, I am very happy with my decision and so is she.  She played with the Kindle Fire on our two hour car ride today and was completely consumed.  She's still not as savvy on navigating the Fire, but she seems to be getting oriented quickly.  Our 2.5 year old has been able to play with the IPad and Jenna, our 5 year old, plays with what she calls her ""big Iphone"" which is the Fire.  No more fighting between the kids and I am able to use the IPad a lot more.  I have monkeyed around with the Fire as well and can say that it is a well built device with a very sharp and colorful display.  I watched a few minutes of a movie on it and got immersed pretty quickly.Based on our child's use model (game and learning apps in addition to video on Youtube and Netflix) I think the Fire will be a great value for $200.And I've gotta say, I would have been highly disappointed with the Leap Pad if I would have ordered it sight unseen from Amazon.  It looks robust and significant.  However, when I checked it out on display in Target, it was pretty puny.  I think that after getting spoiled to an Ipad, the Leap Pad would have been a huge letdown for our child.  The Fire, on the other hand, is a very suitable substitute.",NA,"[3, 3]",1

"Freezing up My daughter's leappad seems to be working fine until we play the Bubble Guppies App. It's here favorite and whenever she plays the video, halfway through it freezes completely up (screen goes clear) and we have to take the batteries out to turn it off. Does anyone else have this problem or is it just ours?",descriptive,"Ok so its not just ours. My daughters leappad froze up twice while using Pet Pad. Like you said it won't shut off so you have to take the batteries out every time. I just looked up the warrenty information and it sucks! I bought hers several months before Christmas to beat the holiday rush so the warrenty period is over and theres no way I can return it to the store. Before I found this thread I couldn't find anyone with the same issue.  When I get home from work I will follow others advice and check our firewall settings, and download any updates then I will uninstall/reinstall app center thru the site instead of using the CD. We have Windows 7 so hopefully updating will fix the issue. IF not I will call leapfrog to see if they can offer any help. Its such a shame b/c we buy many leapfrog products and have never had an issue before :(. Will let you know if we find the fix. ~MARY",NA,"[1, 2]",0

"Is 8 years old too old for Leappad?? My son just turned 8 years old, Those of you that have these in your homes, what do you think?? Is he too old or does the Leappad still have apps and games that he would be interested in?",descriptive,"Jewel train, Sugar Bugs and Alphabet Stew are the titles geared toward the older children. There are 2 new Discovery videos geared toward the 5-9 age group. Other than that, the selection may be limited and your son may find it interesting a few days and they he may quickly outgrow the product.  I hope that Leapfrog expands their library toward the 7-10 age range.There are maybe 3 to 4 cartridge games also for the 5-9 age range like X-Man and NFL Rush Zone.If I was in yours shoes, I would perhaps consider buying a Nintendo DS as they also have good educational titles and also play some of the leisure games with the same device. Our 6 year old is getting the LeapPad as well as the Nintendo DS Lite (same price now).  Hope this is helpful.",NA,"[5, 5]",1

Is he too old or does the Leappad still have apps and games that he would be interested in?",descriptive,"I think if I were you I would choose a nook color or a amazon fire for her so that she can play games, watch movies and choose the appropriate reading level for her. If you go to ebay and search banesandnobleinc under community you can buy a refurbished nook color on for $149 directly from barnes and noble and you can get a otterbox to protect it. Another option is that you could get her a ipod touch so that you can use the content you already have and add to it with a otterbox.Also with the nook you have the option to root it at later date and turn it into a low end android tablet for her when she is older so it will grow with her.I know that I will probably catch some flack for this suggestion but I don't care.

How long have you have this wagon? Are all the parts still working good so far?,descriptive,I've had this one for almost 2 years now.  The only reported design flaw on this wagon is how the front wheels are welded to the frame.  They will hold fine as long as you aren't too rough with heavily loading it or using it on rough terrain.  If you're heavily loaded you have to go over bumps carefully and pull up on the front so they don't bend back and or break the welds.  I'm a hobby welder so I simply reinforced the legs when mine started showing signs of stress.  Another alternative that doesn't require a welder might be to pick up a couple pieces of conduit strap from your local hardware store and screw it into the frame to give the leg welds a little more support.,NA,"[2, 2]",1

I'm thinking of sticking some felt pads on the back to reduce the noise. Is there a flat spot on the back where I could stick them?,descriptive,"Nope.Its not flat and its kind of hallow. The product was so badly designed,  The moment the ball hits the board (which holds the basket) the links which you use to adjust the height will break loose and you end up assemble everything again. I have applied a tape to hold the links and the hook that holds the entire unit. Another bad design, if your kid applies little force on the basket, the lock which hold the basket in its position will break loose and it gets locked in the downward position and you have apply force to bring it back (which is not easy) to its position and there is no easy way or lock release to bring it back to correct position.",NA,"[3, 3]",1
I'm thinking of sticking some felt pads on the back to reduce the noise. Is there a flat spot on the back where I could stick them?,descriptive,"I agree with Suryanarayana - it's a hollowed-out plastic design and the edges aren't wide enough to attach felt to to put an end to the noise. A significant portion of the noise is generated when the hoop comes away from the hanging surface, as the motion of the ball making it through the basket sways the backstop. My suggestion?

If you have it plugged in correctly it will automatically turn on with a loud beep and display voltages for overall and individual cells. It should be set to alarm at voltages 3.3v per cell from the factory.  There is a small button between the buzzers that you can raise the voltage limit when you have it connected.

Is this eclipse 2nd edition (3rd printing)?,descriptive,"I would say that, no, it isn't. Two reasons: 1) The price on this product has been steadily dropping for the past couple of months to move them out of inventory. 2) The 2nd edition box art is slightly different than what is pictured, here. On the new box art, there is an alien character wearing red in place of that blue guy in the lower right.

I spoke with someone at Hape who said that the older model does NOT come with a baby but that they now make a newer model that DOES include a baby. So if you're dealing with a retailer through Amazon who has the old stock, you're out of luck. On top of that, Amazon rotates who they pull their stock from so even if you DO contact the seller to see if they have the newer model, they may not be the seller that Amazon pulls that item from when you finally order it.

Why has the price gone up twice in the last month?,descriptive,"The price of the Jabbas Palace has fluctuated quite a bit in the last few months, this is partly due to its being retired by Lego and holiday demand.

How does this compare to the LonPos puzzle??,descriptive,"I thought they were the same thing when I first saw IQ Fit. (We have the LonPos puzzle as ""Kanoodle"".)It is a different puzzle. This board has holes in it. You have to place all the pieces into the puzzle so the top is completely flat. Therefore, to get everything in the right places, you have to turn twist and make sure the excess nubs go down into the board holes. The challenges tell you where to place a few of the pieces. Then you have to figure out the rest. Personally, I like this one more than LonPos.",NA,"[2, 2]",1
How does this compare to the LonPos puzzle??,descriptive,"It's virtually the same as the Lonpos puzzle.  There is a version of Lonpos  that's 3d, i.e., you have to build a pyramid . I think it was Mindware that used to sell it. Haven't seen that anywhere else.",NA,"[0, 1]",0

Give them the tablet and they just take off like a rocket learning. With a few guided lessons and with just the right apps your child will certainly enjoy using and growing with the Leapfrog LeapPad Tablet. we've had ours since my son was 3 1/2  but my God daughter turned 3 this September and she sits down with it and taps away and watches videos, takes photos and tries playing games.   great part is they don't grow out of it for a while when they are that long and its so durable that even if a child has the dropsy's its still safe to use. My son has thrown ours several times and it just amazes me that it still works I can't say the same for his other gaming counsel.",NA,"[12, 12]",1

She's very smart but she does have difficulty with tracing the letters and numbers in the ""pet"" application.  However, for a 2-1/2 year old I'm sure that it would be useful, just as long as it keeps their attention.  Some kids do better than others.  Mine has a bit more energy and can only play for a short time before wanting to get up and go.  If the device lasts long enough, it should be useful for up to 9 years, but I'm sure we'll have quite better equipment to choose from by then.",NA,"[6, 6]",1
Apps If I have 2 of the LeapPad 2 can I put the same app on both if I buy it or would I have to buy the same app 2 times to put it on both LeapPads?,descriptive,HI Daniel. I do not believe you would have to purchase the app twice. I actually had my LeapPad wiped clean due to an update and the downloads where right there in my download center where it shows just which apps I had previously purchased. I just clicked the + sign and downloaded the apps again. I called Leapfrog and they walked me through it. Just to be certain I'd call if I were you. The customer service reps are very helpful.,NA,"[2, 2]",1
Apps If I have 2 of the LeapPad 2 can I put the same app on both if I buy it or would I have to buy the same app 2 times to put it on both LeapPads?,descriptive,I did this today. You can add to 3 devices. The catch is that the download has to be from the same parent account. I downloded it onto one leappad then all I had to do was plug in the other device and it synced the new apps to the other device. It is quite simple to do. If you go to leapfrogs site under the FAQ it is the first question on there and it gives step by step instructions. Good luck and enjoy the peace and having your smart device back.,NA,"[2, 2]",1
Is it worth buying if we already have the Leapster Explorer?,descriptive,"The reason we bought the LeapPad 2 was to support emergent reading skills in our kindergarten student. The device uses the same games as Leapster Explorer but can also run the ultra books which are reading-focused. We have learned that the kids also love the cartoon-making program which appears to only be on LeapPad and not Leapster Explorer. The reason we chose LeapPad 2 over LeapPad 1 was because you get double the hard drive capacity and double the memory for $30 or less. So to answer your question, yes I would buy it even if I already had the Leapster Explorer, especially if you have more than one child because they can take turns with the two devices. We bought each of our children (5 and 8) the LeapPad 2 and they play with these more than their Nintendo DSi's- and our five year old is now sounding out and writing words fairly successfully.",NA,"[2, 2]",1

How do you monitor the temperature? I read someone's comment that it was too hot for her chicks and they were burned.

Is this a hard step up from a Syma S107? I have about a year's experience with the S107 and my Lama-5.,descriptive,"Yes, it will be a difficult transition. First, the controls are different. The Syma has the rudder control on the  right stick, while the Nano has it on the left. Second, the Syma is a fixed pitch coaxial bird that is designed to be super stable. The Nano is a collective pitch bird that is designed for acrobatics, and hence, much less stable. Plus, the Nano is really small and really fast and will get away from you easily. The recommended transition is from coaxial to fixed pitch to collective pitch. So, a better option for you is to go with the fixed pitch Blade mSRX.",NA,"[4, 4]",1
Is this a hard step up from a Syma S107? I have about a year's experience with the S107 and my Lama-5.,descriptive,"It's not at all the same experience. I too stepped up to this from the S107 and S107G. The Coaxial Helis are very easy to fly and do the hard work for you. The CPx is a true collective pitch Heli which means it's capable of 3D manuvers, this also means that it requires a lot of work to keep stable and can fly out of control very easily. I find the experience of flying this Heli quite a bit more frustrating than flying the Syma, but also a lot more rewarding. You will want to have a large space with little to no wind to practice flying this one. The plus side is that it is quite powerful for its size and it's very very durable. If you're at all interested in learning how to fly collective pitch helis this is a really good first step. You can practice indoors on bad weather days and crashing is no problem because of it's durability and replacement parts are relatively inexpensive. You may also look into getting the Phoenix4 simulator with this as well. It will save you some crashes and the transmitter that comes with the CPx RTF will plug right into it. You can also fly other helicopter and plane models for fun with that software package. Hope this helped, good luck!",NA,"[5, 5]",1

Is this a hard step up from a Syma S107? I have about a year's experience with the S107 and my Lama-5.,descriptive,"I would recommend going to a Blade MSR First....it is the next step (intermediate) from a coaxial heli like the Syma 107.....I started flying Heli's back in November on the coaxials (syma).  Then I tried the Blade MCX2 (which is a nicer version of the symas.).  Then went to the blade MSR which is more advanced, yet you can always let go of the control sticks and it will go back to hover.  With the Collective Pitch heli's, such as the nano, you cannot get away with that.  I am now love the nano and it is my favorite to fly, but you need to work you way up to it.",NA,"[2, 2]",1
Is this a hard step up from a Syma S107? I have about a year's experience with the S107 and my Lama-5.,descriptive,"This is a big jump from an S107.  Look at an inexpensive 4-channel fixed-pitch micro heli like a v911 first - cheaper, easier to fly, but still nimble and will get you used to the basics of four channel control.  Once you can make the v911 go where you want, then the complexity, cost, challenge, and capability of a collective pitch helicopter like this might be more approachable.",NA,"[2, 2]",1

is it a hard step up from a blade mcx2,yesno,"Yes, that's a pretty big jump.  The mcx2 is a coaxial and so will be very stable in the air and will return to a stable hover if you release the cyclic (assuming the throttle is set correctly for a hover).  The Nano is a different beast entirely.  For one thing, it isn't stable in the air and won't hold a steady hover for more than a few seconds, if at all.  If you push the cycle in one direction, the copter will continue in that direction until you give opposite cyclic.  Holding a steady hover requires many tiny cyclic inputs a second.  I would recommend getting a good sim first and learn to fly 6-channel collective pitch copters in the sim before ever buying your first real one.",Y,"[2, 2]",1
"I been flying quadcopters for a while now, I want a helicopter. would this be a good transition from quad to helis?",yesno,"I think a better option might be a 4-channel rather than a collective pitch copter like the Nano.  4-channel copters (like the v911) are stable in the air and if you release the cyclic, they will return to a hover on their own.  A CP heli will not--they are not stable and will not hover by themselves for more than a second or two.  They are very fast and they will shoot across the room (or into you) almost too fast to see at first.I'm not saying it can't be done, mind you...but expect to crash frequently and spend quite a bit of money on parts at first.",NA,"[2, 2]",1

Can it hover without any input or must we make constant inputs?,descriptive,"The X1 is amazing at hovering!  [I've had 4 of them so far]There are a few things that have to be done to make this happen..Turn the transmitter on.  Center all of the trim buttons..You'll hear a series of beeps/tones as they center.When they're zero'd out, turn the transmitter off.Now for the X1 - The quad needs to bind and calibrate.When it is turned on, two things happen, it binds to the transmitter, and, it uses it's position, remember it, and uses that to fly, so, it is extremely important that the X1 is not just on a 'flat' surface, but a 'level' surface too!If the X1 calibrates 100% level, it will hover and fly level.If it calibrates off-level, it will lean that way when in the air, not hover, and wander..So, Transmitter on, X1 on a super level surface, then on, it'll beep, flash, lock into the bind, calibrate, then it'll be ready to go![Make sure that the X1 is not touched / perfectly still during this]When it is flown, if close to the ground, there will be 'ground effects' / turbulence from the props..This can and will cause the quad to wander around..Make sure to fly it about 4ft-6ft high, then check it for levelness / hover..The quad should hover just fine.  If it has a bit of drift to it, just click the trim button on the transmitter in the opposite direction to compensate..Trimming:  The X1 takes a few seconds to respond to trim inputs, so, click the trim button 1 or 2 times, then wait for the quad to react..Repeat if needed.  You're good to go!Also, these quads WILL fly using the FlySky protocol, so, a FlySky TH-9X,  or Turnigy 9X [same thing] transmitter w/ FlySky module will fly them.The OEM transmitter is okay, but, the 9X is just awesome!

Which one is better in YOUR opinion: Elite Rayven or Elite Stockade? Why?,descriptive,"Personally I'd prefer the Elite Rayven because it is CS (clip system) compatible and more functional.  For me, it's all about functionality.  Both are flywheel blasters and require batteries to use.  However, it is by far easier to load the Rayven than the Stockade.  The Stockade has 10 shots before you have to reload and reloading takes time as it is a front fed blaster.  The Rayven uses ""clips"" ranging from 6, 12, 18, 25, & 35 dart capacity and once you use an entire clip, you can drop the empty one and load another full clip.  Also, the Rayven comes with it's 18-dart firefly tech clip (which you can load 18 darts or use glow-in-the-dark clips for night games).  Another reason why I prefer the Rayven is that it's not as front heavy compared to the Stockade as it is a ""Bullpup"" design.  Both of them you can dual wield, but the Rayven has much better dart capacity and faster reload time.  The only reason why I'd get the Stockade is for it's butt stock as it's one of the better ones.  If you're looking for ammo capacity and ease of loading, go with the Elite Rayven.",NA,"[2, 2]",1

"In comparison to ""BANG! (La Pallottola!) The Bullet!""  Does this set have more or less the same cards?",descriptive,"The Bullet has a lot more cards because it has all of the expansions (at the time of print) whereas the 10th anniversary edition has the regular cards with only some extra - they took the most popular cards from each expansion and put them in. I have played both versions and in my opinion the 10th anniversary edition is much better. It has the playing squares for each individual and it has the little bullets to keep track of your ""lives"". The Bullet does not have these. Also, some of the characters in the Bullet are actually not fun (might just be my opinion, but there is one in particular that, if you get it combined with another card you can't lose, making it horrible for everyone else). I prefer the 10th anniversary, but if you want all the expansions and you don't care about the little cardboard game pieces then the Bullet will be fine.",NA,"[2, 2]",1

Are these cards flammable? Can they be used to fend off zombies in the coming apocalypse?,descriptive,"Is this one question, or two separate ones?

I recommend that you do exactly that.",NA,"[20, 21]",0
Are these cards flammable? Can they be used to fend off zombies in the coming apocalypse?,descriptive,"I would argue that these cards are of more use as a deterrent.  It's been proven in approximately zero clinical trials that excessive use of this product creates a slime-like coating (of pure evil) around your brain that makes it difficult for zombies to smell it.As for flammability, I would recommend strongly against using this product while on fire -- in fact, I think there should be a disclaimer to this effect.  Successful use at Burning Man does hint they can be used within the same general proximity as open flame.  I believe the actual flammability of the cards themselves is likely somewhere between the two.",NA,"[20, 21]",0

The control board (mother board) is a different color too. I believe the V959 is blue and the V222 is green.     As far as the transmitter I received I couldn't comment since I sent it back. I did end up ordering from another company out of China. It did come with the dual mode transmitter.,NA,"[2, 2]",1

We used these paints with brushes and and a styrofoam meat tray as a pallet when my daughter was between 18-24mo. It is a smooth paint that can be thinned out with water. Starting with brushes and of course close adult supervision will help prevent child from eating paint while still allowing your child an enriching art experience.

Has Citadels stood up to the test of time? Have other games built on its core strengths surpassed it?,descriptive,"The great aspect of this game is you have to customize each game you play with the resource cards you have and don't have and the role cards that are in play.  If a player doesn't adapt their game play there are plenty of opportunities to derail their plans.  2 and 3 player games tend to get lobsided as two roles are in play each round, but plays very well 4-6 players.  Still trying to get a 7 or more together.  The more players however the longer time needed.  Also some of the cards rules aren't clear and if misinterpreted can offset the balance of the game.

Pls let me know, thanks!!",descriptive,"I use an X-Acto #1 knife with a few #11 size blades.  These are great. I highly recommend a Tamiya 74001 Side Cutter for Plastic (or similar product but the Tamiya one is top quality) to remove parts from the trees. For glue, old fashioned Testors tube glue is handy for the main hull parts and sticking some of the small parts in place.  For overall gluing, I use Tamiya Extra Thin liquid cement.  Some Tamiya Basic (grey) putty will be handy for the hull seam, if that  kind of thing is important.  You can get some assorted wet and dry sandpaper from a local hardware store to smooth out the putty.  I chose not to use the kit's somewhat inaccurate painting guide and used colors based on specific Arizona information you can find online.  But, in general, I used some of the excellent Tamiya spray paints for the hull and superstructure colors.  I finished the decks by hand with several coats of enamel wood color/deck tan paint.  If you don't have all of the supplies up front you can pick them up as you need them.  Some things like a parts cutter are fairly expensive but once you have one, you have it for many, many, years.

Can they be hung on a tree limb?,descriptive,"Generally, swings work best when each leg is of equal length. If your tree limb is horizontal, it should work ok. Using a tree limb can be risky, as the limb may break. Also, girdling the limb may kill the branch. A strong, sturdy, horizontal limb, demonstrated to carry at least 5 times the weight of the child without signs of strain, and pierced by anchor hooks double-bolted at the top, may be effective. This does NOT imply any warranty or assurance on my part - use at your own (and your child's) risk.",NA,"[2, 2]",1

It comes with 4 long U shaped spikes and straps that secure it to the ground. If the child swings to hard it will come up on the pavement. We built ours on the concrete patio and I tried it for sturdiness before moving it onto the mulch of the playground, it definately slides and the small end (without the house) will rock back and forth. Even now when I swing next to my son (he's one, and in the baby swing and I'm about 115 pounds) it moves a little bit and it's anchored in really good.

"I can't decide between the party or family edition.  We have four in our family...adults are 52, kids are 14 and 11.  Does anybody have any suggestion",descriptive,"W&W; Family is the best edition when playing with young kids. The questions make sense to a 5 year old, the game does not use poker chips (there is no gambling), and the rules are the most simple of all three editions.The original W&W; is a little more complicated than the other editions. It incorporates the excitement of Vegas by including a felt mat that has different payout odds for each of the guesses. The questions in this edition are the most academic of the three options. It was designed as a party game for adults. None of the content is inappropriate for kids, but some of the questions are about things which they will not have heard of (like Michelangelo's David sculpture, Copernicus theory of the Earth revolving around the Sun, or Martin Luther King's I have a Dream speech).W&W; Party is a combination of the other two editions. The rules are very simple (like the Family edition), but you are allowed to bet your poker chips on the last question. The questions are lighter than the original W&W; (some of them are very silly), but they are not geared for kids. This edition was designed to play with all three generations over the holidays. It was designed to get people interacting and having fun as quickly as possible.  This is the edition I would recommend for your family.

Math is a painful subject but really simple if you have a calyoomalator and revisit Mr. Pythagoras' theorem and you will get the guestimate down right.  Roughly the slant(s) = 14 feet and the height will be = 12 feet (that is from the ground to the top of the horizontal beam.  Using the equilateral triangle for the example which all 3 sides are equal and proposed one side is = 2a, where it would be roughly about 14 feet then the height will perpendicular to the ground intersect the bottom side which divide two segments of a and a.  So if 2a squared = x + a squared, then 4 a squared = 3 a squared + a squared; one side of the equilateral triangle = 2a = 14 feet and therefore a = 7 feet and resulted of squared root of 3(7x7) = is roughly about 12 feet.  IF YOUR HEAD IS HURTING AT THIS POINT...JOIN THE CLUB!  So with the 12 feet as the height now you can figure out its radius for clearance of either side of the swing.

can i adjust this gun so less paint can flow out,yesno,"This is a dual action Airbrush. If you have never used an airbrush, dual action means basically that as you press down the trigger the air flows through the brush, as you pull the trigger back the more paint flows. This means that you have total control of the paint flow. Now the more expensive the dual action the ""thinner"" the line of paint that flows through the nozzle of the brush. This Brush is a good starter brush and its my second unit. The first unit was a suction unit and I loaned it out (Don't do this :) ) and the person basically destroyed the brush by not thinning the paint correctly, not cleaning it, and using a metallic fleck paint that should never be used without being an advanced user.

Wal Mart Price - 59.88 What's the deal here?????? Supply and Demand.....What a great Christmas spirit!!!!I wonder what can be exploited next year.What's even more unbelievable is that people will actually pay such an inflated price.$ea$on$ Greeting$,descriptive,"Whaa whaa whaa.  If the price is not right for you don't buy.  There is no better way to match up supply and demand than flexible prices.  Long live the free market!That said, for general consumer goods most sellers find that a fairly stable pricing policy works best in the long run.  spotting outrageous prices for some items tends to make customers much more wary of the vendor.  Most retailers realize that the few extra bucks to be made on a hot item, aren't worth diminishing the trust relationship with customers.",NA,"[1, 3]",0
"age appropriateness? I teach third grade and am considering buying this kid-friendly camera for my classroom.

"Outrageous Prices for this Butterscotch Pony How can people sleep at night knowing that they have swindled innocent parents out of hard earned, or borrowed money.

Okay here goes.....Unzip the zipper and locate the two screws that have the thread like plastic running from one screw to the other screw.  Okay now that you have located them UNSCREW the screw that is nearest the bottom and relocate it to the hole that is up further (you will see the empty hole that the screw goes in).  The string like plastic IS STILL connecting the two.  You are now screwing it into the part that attatches the head.  Previously it was screwed into the bottom obstructing the mechanism that turns the head from side to side.  Hope this helped.  Let me know.God bless you,Susan Urban",NA,"[5, 5]",1

I am working on a student project with my daughter and I am at my wits end on this.,descriptive,"The arm is nowhere near long enough to reach a full meter.I can imagine a couple of approaches; but the real answer would be some much larger arm.1. You could mount the base on a rail to get any range you want.2. Or you could build extensions to the sections of the arm, but that would require a lot of modification, good mechanical skill, and would result in a very weak arm barely able to support itself.3. You could use the arm as a working model, recycle what pats you can, and simply build a larger-scale model of it.",NA,"[3, 3]",1

"So with it being modular, do the sections have a problem with sliding around when the child is trying to play with it?",yesno,"Actually, yes in our case.  They do not latch in any way, although they're not so slippery that they are going to fall apart badly during normal play - an occasional straightening by an older child will be all they need.  But in our case, our two year old and her four-year-old brother were constantly intentionally disassembling the rooms, such that they ended up all over the room in which they were playing, and I could see that it wouldn't be long before one or more got stepped in, sat upon, or otherwise unintentionally broken - not to mention the general clutter they caused. My solution was to zip-tie most of the sections together.  (A few cannot be attached in this manner because of the way the walls are built.)  I did this at least 7-8 months ago, and it really solved the problem.  They've basically forgotten that it comes apart at all, and I haven't had to worry about it.  When they're older, I will remove the zip-ties.",NA,"[2, 2]",1

Do any of you recommend the game for children younger than 13?  What would be challenging or inappropriate for younger players?,descriptive,"The game is stated to be for 10 and up.

We play it with my nieces who are 11, 13 and 17.  We get silly with the answers.  If you have Apples to Apples, it is much like that but this is much more fun because individuals can write their own answers instead of picking from the ones in their hands and in Apples to Apples the kids may not understand/know about some of the history/people.  There are other versions of the game, can't tell you what the name of the board game is but it is similar to Say Anything.  THERE IS A SAY ANYTHING ""FAMILY VERSION""",NA,"[3, 3]",1

If you note in the video above with the description, the ball is always off the track and loose in the ball when the little boy has it. That shows you how difficult it is for a younger kid.

How does this set differ from the 'Structures' set and does one have an advantage over the other?  If you were to buy only one of them- which one?,descriptive,The only difference is that this one has the balls. I would have bought this one first had I seen it before the other structures set.

How does this set differ from the 'Structures' set and does one have an advantage over the other?  If you were to buy only one of them- which one?,descriptive,"Sarah,The instructions are different. Pretty sure the planks are the same/interchangeable. It really depends on whether you prefer to have instructions to build structures or contraptions.    I have 3 sets of contraptions.

Now, I'll need to purchase a 4th set just to get the structures instructions:(So, decide which one your child might really want to build first, and if he/she likes it a lot, then get a set of the other one as well.Personal opinion: the contraptions are fun.

You could go to the eight cell 9.6v battery like the Traxxas series 5 5000 mAh battery, but you will need to do a very good break in on your motor and need to really watch the heat and power surge, or you will go through motors and XL-5 ESCs quickly... we can attest to that.

Did anyone get instructions in ENGLISH for this product??,descriptive,"Yes, I do. I can scan them and email it to you if you'd like. My email address is andrew.hradesky@hotmail.com. Also, if properly assembled, it works great without falling apart. I use it in class when instructing light pollution to students. UPDATE: 14 December 2014 - Okay, I've owned my AstroStar projector for one year and it still operates just like it did when I first received it! Despite what the other reviews discuss on how the globe falls apart, being a pile of junk, etc . . .  it is not and mine has not shown any of those characteristics. Care and patience is a must when assembling. The batteries will drain rapidly if left ""on"" for long periods since it operates on two AA size, so turn ""off"" when not needed, it is not an all evening night light. My only complaint is really my fault. When applying the scale stickers, my thumbs got in the way thus the sticky part at the ends have lost their effectiveness, thus, a tiny piece of clear plastic tape solved that issue immediately.",NA,"[3, 3]",1

"I've heard it makes multiple sounds, do they all sound like the regular quick pulsing sound the Doctor's makes?",yesno,"Hey Jake.  It actually makes multiple sounds.  In the ""closed"" or ""open"" position, hitting the button (on the bottom or side) makes the classic pulsing sound in a high and low tone.  If you double-tap the button, it makes a sort of old school laser gun noise.  If you triple-tap the button, it makes a struggling pulse sound, like the sonic is malfunctioning.   I do want to note a little quirk with the device.  If you have the sonic in the ""open"" position, the side button becomes obscured, which means you have to use the bottom button.  This makes it kind of awkward to grip the sonic and activate the sounds.  Hope that helps.",NA,"[19, 19]",1

What size airplanes does it take.  My son loves the movie Planes and I brought some small planes for him from the movie and I am looking for an airpor,descriptive,"Hi! I bought this set last Christmas. I don't know about the planes from the movie as we don't have any of those, but it does fit typical matchbox size planes (the metal ones)--my son has several different styles and a matchbox space shuttle--they are all probably 4 inches long and wing span might be 4 inches or so as well. I can actually fit about six matchbox planes inside this with it closed along with the two planes and helicopter that come with it--it really does hold a lot. I have to say, of all the things my son plays with (he is 4 1/2), this is played with almost every day for the entire past year! I just put it away again today! I love it--great buy. Nothing has broken on it at all. The clips to hold the runway together are frustrating for some people, but I just keep them put away until he asks for them and then we clip it together. Otherwise he just lays the runway pieces together and doesn't seem to mind that they're not ""attached"" to each other. I hope this review helps!

"Amazon Doesn't Get It LeapFrog LeapPad Explorer Learning Tablet (Pink) (Toy) Like many, I have been trying to catch one of the LeapPads Amazon occasionally releases for $99.00. After two days of on and off watching, I finally got one in my cart, selected next day shipping, and then when I clicked on which credit card, you guessed it, it came back no longer available! I don't understand why when you put it your cart it is not reserved at that point. If you were at a store and put something in your cart and pushing it up to the checkout would an employee come and pull it out of your cart? I understand that people put items in carts on Amazon and then don't purchase them, but the simple solution to that is give them 5 minutes, 10 minutes, or whatever to complete the transaction, send them a warning email, and if they don't buy it move it back to inventory and put it in their Wishlist. Amazon, a boss once told me ""It is five times easier to keep customers you have, then to get a new customer""",descriptive,"What I am saying is simple, if it goes in the cart then you have a limited amount of time to complete the transaction.  It is not complicated, Ticketmaster does this everyday with every transaction.   I don't have a problem with Amazon saying they are out of stock or not available, but if you can click add it to your cart and it GOES into your cart, you select shipping, and then select your credit card, it should come back and say no longer available. Once in the cart you should have a limited amount of time to complete the transaction.  If you don't complete it, it goes back into inventory.  If you put something in your cart at the local store, they don't take it out at the cash register and tell you can't have it.  Not rocket science.",NA,"[0, 1]",0

Does it require a lot of reading of the cards/rules etc during the gameplay?,descriptive,"The learning curve can be steep if more than one person is playing but the manner in which the scenario guide is written, the game designer exposes you to the different mechanics in stages.  It make the initial playthroughs of the different scenarios very helpful.  The rulebook and scenario guide are both twenty pages long and written in a small font type but it is not even close to the convoluted mess that Magic Realm rules were.  There are plenty of youtube videos (the best being done by Rick Royal) and other internet support that go through the gameplay and mechanics.  There are cue cards that come with the game to provide concise explanations of rules and gameplay.  That is a big part of the enjoyment of playing this game solo; you learn as you discover at your own pace.  If you are looking for a game that you can pick up all the nuances after the first playthrough then this game is not for you.  If you enjoy the experience of discovering new things after rereading a good story or repeated viewing of a well-made movie, this game was made for you.",NA,"[2, 2]",1
How is the learning curve? Does it require a lot of reading of the cards/rules etc during the gameplay?,descriptive,"Yes, there are 2 booklets 20-some pages long.

There are also videos on YouTube of people telling you how to play if reading the rules is too tedious, which it definitely can be.",NA,"[2, 2]",1
How is the learning curve? Does it require a lot of reading of the cards/rules etc during the gameplay?,descriptive,"It does. There is a great video by Ricky Royal that will eliminate most of that, because while there are a ton of rules to this game, they all make sense in the grand scheme of things, so that once you have the rules down, there's very little ""re-remembering"" - the rules kind of stick, once you have them down. Here is the link to that video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_zW9zDxeYUGood luck!",NA,"[2, 2]",1
How is the learning curve? Does it require a lot of reading of the cards/rules etc during the gameplay?,descriptive,"The learning curve is quite steep. I recommend thoroughly reading the instructions before playing and also suggest watching playthroughs and reviews on youtube (it helped me quite a bit). You do have to read cards throughout gameplay as well as refer to the rules quite a bit but don't let that deter you. The game is very enjoyable and once you read the rules, set up the game, and play through the first game they set up in the rulebook, it's pretty easy to catch on. The first setup might seem like a bear but it's worth it.",NA,"[2, 2]",1
How many people can play at once?,descriptive,"Hi, Khue. Mage Knight Board Game is a great solitaire game,  but you can comfortably play with two or three. If you are feeling really confident you can add a fourth person, but know that that might take a long time. With the Lost Legion expansion you can add a fifth character and if you get the Krang character expansion you could potentially add a sixth player for a competitive game.The maximum number of players you can have in a cooperative game is usually one less than in a competitive one because you need ine character to be a dummy player. You can avoid that if you get an app called Mage Knight Dummy Player. 1-4 players competitively, 2-3 cooperatively. I hope that answered your question!JD Woody""Live and Let Dice"", adrenalineradio.com",NA,"[7, 7]",1

Does it need batteries to shoot? Or are they optional?,descriptive,"No.  All shooting is mechanical, no batteries needed.  This is a well made toy gun and the disks, especially the red ones, shoot very well.  The disks can get a bit pricey depending on how much and where you ""play"".  Batteries are for the ""clip"".  They are not needed, but when installed you can turn your clip ""on"".  This activates a light inside the clip that keeps ""White""disks glowing in the dark.  Seems very silly, right?  That is what I thought untill my two children and I used the glow in the dark (white) disks, with the clips turned on and all lights in the house off.  They loved it and with winter coming, it's a fun indoor activity.  Disks can sting if hit in the face but they have not caused any human or property damage in our home.

Fully extended his wings can reach about 1 foot from longest tip to tip.He is extremely poseable and able to recreate almost any pose or stance from the anime which alters his dimensions vastly, but I think I gave an accurate dimension in general.Freedom is absolutely BEAUTIFUL and possibly the best Gundam in my collection.

Is this doable for a beginner who has never soldered? The other elenco kits just seem too basic.,descriptive,"I would recommend a smaller kit to learn to solder, like the cricket or Christmas tree. There are a few others available from the same company. Master the basics first, too much heat on the board in this kit or solder blobs will be very hard to fix. Even more so, if you don't know how. Buy a mid price range soldering iron, a good pair of diagonal cutting pliers, and plenty of solder; practice your tinning with old phone wire and master the Western union twist first. Elenco is really great when it comes to ordering smaller replacement parts for the kit. I used a multi-meter as well when I built the kit and it works better than some of the already assembled radios I have bought over the years. Good luck to you whichever way you chose to go.",NA,"[3, 3]",1
Is this doable for a beginner who has never soldered? The other elenco kits just seem too basic.,descriptive,"If you never soldered, I would not recommend doing that. The kit is relatively easy to solder, and it's doable, but most likely you will need to calibrate your hand on something simpler and the basic kits are inexpensive. As a beginner, the hardest (and funnier) part is to troubleshoot the kit and when I started assembling it, I had one bad solder at the first section. Have fun!",NA,"[2, 2]",1

If you have very minerally water (ie well water) try using purified bottled water. Regardless boil it first. The hazyness comes from microscopic bubbles trapped in solution.

Does each furby turn evil?,descriptive,"It doesn't get ""evil"" as in it threatens to kill you or your child, lol We aren't talking ""Chuckie"" here.

With mine it tends to be more ""Valley Girl"" than anything. I call her a ""she"" and ""she"" does other personalities but always goes back to the ""Valley Girl"" one, even after excessive play making her take on the giggly ""nutty"" one. So no, your Furby isn't going to get red eyes and fangs and go get a kitchen knife and threaten you or your child, or say bad words or anything. It just gets cranky and ACTS cranky. It will still laugh, but it sounds more ""tough guy"" than sweet and funny. Just play with it and love it and it will go right back to it's original personality.",NA,"[4, 4]",1

Should I put paper towel under the eggs 3 days before they hatch?,descriptive,"I don't use a paper towel- I cut felt to size and put that in there after I take the turning plate out.

Should I put paper towel under the eggs 3 days before they hatch?,descriptive,"I do, based on what other friends who also use the Brinsea Mini Advance suggested.  The paper towel gives better traction to the hatching chicks by giving them traction.  You can risk a chick getting Splayed feet if they can't get good traction.    What I do is stack 3 or 4 paper towels, use the auto-egg turner base and trace around it, both the outside circle and the inside (water resevoir) circle.  Then cut the circles out.  They then are easy to slip onto the Brinsea floor.  Also, the paper towel makes it easy to remove the cracked egg shells and you can replace the towel in just a second or two.  Best of luck!

"Can this incubator handle duck eggs? If so, how many at a time?",descriptive,7 duck eggs should fit in there with the turner according to Brinsea website. I've only hatched chicken eggs in it & there is plenty of room so I would say 7 duck eggs would fit as well,NA,"[2, 2]",1
"Can this incubator handle duck eggs? If so, how many at a time?",descriptive,It does let you do the Duck eggs. Make sure that you mark a line on the eggs to make sure that they're making a full rotation. Also make sure on your rotation number that you increase the number so the rotation rolls longer and the egg is incubated better. Make sure that you keep your water full with the duck eggs being larger and shell sometime thicker. It does hold them but it gets a little bit tight. Also when ducks hatch you need to put them in a brooder immediately it is very cramped in the Brinsea. Good luck with your duck hatching.,NA,"[3, 3]",1

"Can this incubator handle duck eggs? If so, how many at a time?",descriptive,"Hi...according to the instructions it can incubate duck eggs; however, the Brinsea Mini is just that, a ""mini"". From my own personal experience, I incubated and hatched 3 chicken eggs in it and that was all I would ever do. It got very crowded quickly, and if you're considering it for hatching duck eggs I wouldn't put more than two at a time in it. Duck eggs are much larger than chicken eggs, and based on that, I'm sure ducklings are bigger too. This is my opinion only, but if I were you, I wouldn't do it.",NA,"[2, 2]",1
what the diffent between the brinsea eco and the brinsea mini advance,descriptive,"First I bought the eco and then I upgraded to the mini advance.  The egg turning is a factor, but heck, it's not that hard to turn the eggs.  Then there's the temperature alarm on the advance, it really helped me.  I could BARELY read the thermometer on the eco, they put it in a difficult location. It was so much easier to have the digital with the alarm.

"My daughter, almost 4, is tracing bowls, glasses, etc. to create circles. What makes this so hard that you all say 7-8 years? I wanted to get her this",yesno,"It is awesome that your daughter can trace bowls and such and get perfect circles. The thing about the Spirograph is that you have a pen point inserted into a tiny hole in a small disc and then you must guide that disc around and around inside a larger circle....all while keeping the teeth on the outer edge of the disc in constant contact with the teeth on the inner edge of the circle. It takes patience and control. I know some adults that have difficulty doing this and the last thing you want to do is give your child a toy that ends up causing frustration instead of joy. You can always buy a Spirograph and start out with you making the designs and letting her choose the discs and colors. Once you figure out which ones only require a few repeats around the pattern to complete it, you might let her try....possibly with you holding onto the pen with her.  I did this with my sisters, I was probably 13 or 14 and they were around 4 or 5. I would also create a complex design and let them color inside the loops or what ever they wanted. They got to participate in the creative process.It is a wonderful toy and can give many hours of enjoyment....or, in my brothers case when we were kids, many hours of frustration and anger (and throwing of my discs!)",NA,"[2, 2]",1

The recommended age is 3-5. I have a 6 year son who absolutely loves trains and different tracks. I was thinking of getting this for him. Is he too old for this?,descriptive,"My twin boys are only two so it's hard for me to say not knowing what a six year old is like maturity wise. The stack track is great because it can really challenge kids giving them the ability to build up as much as around. To really be able to enjoy the diversity of the Chuggington track, though, you would want to buy extra track. This can become a pretty expensive build up but if you are familiar with the prices and don't mind I would certainly recommend the product. All of the different sets are interchangeable which is nice if you do want to build your set.",NA,"[2, 2]",1

How annoying is this toy for an adult?,descriptive,"Haha, your question made me smile :)  The toy is pretty effing annoying BUT our daughter loves it.  It gets her bouncing and dancing and she smiles the whole time.  When we've had enough we just turn it off and tell her it's all done for now and she moves on to another toy.  The joy she gets from it makes it worth it to us.  I do worry that it's a little crazy how fast she can change the sounds and modes on it so we've decided that we would limit her time on the toys like this to 15 minute intervals.  For the price I think it's a great toy but I know for my daughter, she's still in the ""out of sight out of mind phase"" at 1 year old and she doesn't fuss when we turn it off.  Good luck!",NA,"[2, 2]",1
How annoying is this toy for an adult?,descriptive,"Its not at all annoying. I really don't understand your question.

Can anyone compare this to Moon Sand?

Moon sand hates water, and won't let it touch it. Kinetic sand is coated with something that makes it stick to itself for a little while then fall apart. it doesn't like to clump, and won't hold a shape. its mesmerizing to watch it fall apart, and it won't stick to other things either. so it cleans up easy.Moon sand hates water, and probably you as well.

From what I could see from the outset, the preloaded apps are all things that kids don't care about like a clock and calculator, and if you want something fun you have to pay between $7.00 and $25.00 for downloaded apps.

how long is the belt?,descriptive,"It is 92.2 inches long.

Hope this helps.  I went to the whirlpool site and used my serial number to get the right belt part number.  Do the same for the brand you have and you should be fine.",NA,"[2, 3]",0
Can you put in your own CD's or does it just play the ones that come with it? Can the microphones be detached?,descriptive,"Hi Linnie,Thanks for the question. It's a great little machine. I bought it for my grandson who was one and a half.   You can put your own CD's in it and it will also play CD-R's. The microphones are not detachable, so you'll have to be mindful of that. Having said that, we have all had hours of enjoyment playing with it.  My grandson is now 2 and plays with it every day. He loves to push the buttons mostly to start stop and open!!

How many bags do you receive per order?  These retail in store $2.99/bag.  I don't see it mentioned anywhere if this is one bag or several for $7.90.,descriptive,It appears to me that the seller (not Amazon) jacked up the price for those to over 8.00 each. Nice of them to take advantage of the season. If you can't find them on Amazon.com for 2.99each I would purchase from lego directly. Unfortunately you still have to pay shipping so that option is depending on how many you want to buy and if the seller on Amazon is doing free shipping. Not worth getting it from anyone else unless Amazon has it for 3.00 and with prime shipping. Hope this helps some. I purchased a lot of lego and you have to be careful of who you buy from on Amazon as they can grossly overcharge you.,NA,"[3, 3]",1
Can you buy extra batteries for this Air Hogs Helix x4 quadcopter and switch them out after one loses power?,descriptive,"No, the battery is internal with no access...too bad because it flies so well, you could go a lot longer than it lasts.

Can you buy extra batteries for this Air Hogs Helix x4 quadcopter and switch them out after one loses power?,descriptive,"O.K.  I have read and agree with the 5 previous answers, except that I did not find any battery ""plugged into the bottom"" of mine.

Can you buy extra batteries for this Air Hogs Helix x4 quadcopter and switch them out after one loses power?,descriptive,"The copter itself is solid Styrofoam, there are no accessible compartments. So its a little over an hour to charge and you get about 10 minutes of use then back to the charger. No provision to access the battery. One neat feature though that I might look at later is the remote can be set up to share copters. The cool part to that isn't that you could get extra flying time (though you could by having another charged one ready). It means you could charge two and control them at the same time with the same remote. In theory they'd fly in tandem! I'm using this as ""my first quadcopter"", when I feel I'm ready my plan is to upgrade to something more solid.",NA,"[1, 2]",0

It is recommended to steer away from any available devices that would closely affect the field of the Ouija with any kind of electrical item.

This procedure is the same as putting curlers. when you have finished collecting all the straws in curlers hair, prepare a small pot with dell 'almost boiling water and plunge all the doll's hair for about 10 seconds then in another pot with cold water immerse hair for another 10 seconds. do this process for about 6-7 times. dab the doll's hair and do not remove the curlers. put the doll on a pedestal and you have to have patience to wait for the hair to dry in the sun or in the home. when the hair will be dry (it can take a long time even 2-3 days), remove the curlers and your doll will have some gorgeous curls.

What is the difference between Ti- S6 and Ti S5? Thank you.,descriptive,"From what I gather the Ti-S6 is slightly bigger, heavier and thus more powerful than the Ti-S5. As a result, the Ti-S6 is probably more suited for beginners or those players that need more help generating pace. The Ti-S5 is by no means a players racket, but it has a smaller sweet spot and requires you to generate more pace through your swing. If you can hit the bill with a little pace and want more control, I'd go with the Ti-S5. If you struggle to hit the ball hard and need the bigger head to make good contact, go with the Ti-S6.",NA,"[2, 2]",1

Can this tent be washed in some way? Maybe having all the fabric parts (including floor) apart and tossing into the washer...,descriptive,Please don't get this tent. They promised to remove it from this site but ended up putting it right back up. The poles snapped on my hands and some sort of fiber glass went into my skin from this thing. It took months to get to a point where it didn't hurt. I dread to think what would have happened if my daughter rolled around in it and snapped it.,NA,"[0, 1]",0

"Would it be better to use wood glue or cyanoacrylate glue? Also, how do you tighten the tissue on the wings?",descriptive,"Glue ... I prefer wood glue, Elmers white glue or the tan-colored water-proof wood glue.  It's inexpensive and easy to clean up.  The only draw back is the drying time.  Joined surfaces must be taped, clamped or held steady while the glue dries.  This is where the cyanoacrylate (super glue or instant glue) come in handy.  They dry instantly, but the odor and getting the adhesive stuck to your fingers can be a problem.  They both work good.Tissue tightening .... You must first apply the tissue tight and flat as possible.  Use tissue dope (best) or diluted white glue (50/50 with water) to attach a leading or trailing edge first.  When this dries wrap the tissue around the wing and attach to the opposite edge.  Leave the spars or other wood in between unglued.  Wrinkles are the worst and must be avoided.  When the tissue is dry spray the surface lightly with water using a mister or spray bottle.  Do not soak.  Air dry if the room temperature is warm, otherwise put it in the oven with just the light on.  The tissue can be re-soaked and re-dried several times if needed.  Be careful, over-drying can can warp the surface if it gets too tight.Hope this helpsBrad",NA,"[2, 2]",1

Would these fire in lower oxygen environments?  We want to launch a small rocket from 100k feet above sea level.,descriptive,"It is possible, these are blackpowder motors and thus contain both fuel and oxidizer, and ignition is electrical. I think the real issue is will an electric match ignite at that altitude.  But, depending on where you live, this use could possibly require government approval/licensing (http://www.flyrockets.com/regulations.asp)  The regulations are determined by fuel payload but correspond to attainable altitudes.

Does the bottom of the cargo net need to be attached to something?,descriptive,Yes. The net I received must be attached to a base and staked to the ground. All the hardware is included except for the lumber.,NA,"[2, 2]",1
Does the bottom of the cargo net need to be attached to something?,descriptive,I really think it does. Having it unattached would make the ladder much more difficult and dangerous to climb. Falling off of it would likely be easier too since the bottom would be allowed to swing freely if it were unattached. I just attached mine to a 2X4 with holes drilled to feed the rope ends through. Then I attached the 2X4 to stakes pounded into the ground about a foot out from the top of the ladder like in the display picture. I use it all the time so I know it can handle an adults weight.,NA,"[2, 2]",1

"can you do the project   over and over,i want something i can practice on with my 2 in 1 Digital Hot Air Rework & Soldering Iron Station.",yesno,"Not by design but to be able to de-solder is a separate but equal skill and I would consider it the next step in evolving your skill set. I prefer to use a De-soldering Pump but wicking is also an option. When it is time to remove a damaged component or isolate for testing this skill is important.

Granted, it dropped on my hard wood floor (but what doesn't?).Called leapfrog and said they would replace without asking a lot of questions. I guess they are used to the problem.

"Broken Leapster after less than 24 hours I bought a green Leapster for each of my kids for Christmas. I had heard good reviews from friends and family, so I thought I'd get it for them.

"Do the new Leapster Learning Sys Games work on the old Leapster? I am looking at buying a used Leapster Learning System and of course the older Leapster is cheaper.  If I buy the new games, like Cars and Diego, etc, will they work on the old Leapster?",descriptive,Yes they will. I bought the new Dora game for my little girl's leapster and it worked perfectly.

Leapster vs. VSmile Has anyone been able to compare the VSmile Cyber Pocket with the Leapster models?,descriptive,"Hi There!I would say...after playing a little with both...that they are quite equal! I like the Leap Frog Learning Path. It is great to see how my son is doing and what he is learning. Vtech has a similar, but not as parent oriented program..its called vsmile world or something. The part I really like about the VSmile is that you can play the same games in their home game systems as well. I am getting my son the new Vsmile Motion for Xmas. It is like a Wii for younger kids. It will play all of the Vsmile games as well. Very cool. I would say they are both excellent choices...but I have always liked Vtech products. I might be a little biased...who knows!??!Good Luck!

Just bought this a month ago... one of the barrels somehow jumped the track & ground rubber on the edge all day. Where can I get a replacement barrel?,descriptive,"UPDATE:  I will also put this in my review.  I called Tru-Square Metal Products directly: 253-833-2310. I wish I would've gotten the woman's name, as she was so helpful.  She is sending me a new barrel free of charge, and gave me tips on how to keep this from happening again.  I purchased a large can of refried beans to put on the tumbler when only tumbling one barrel (You need the weight, as well as the size).  OLDER ANSWER:I don't understand why you need to purchase a barrel if its a design flaw that, from reading the comments section, seems to be fairly common.  I, too, just purchased mine and the same thing happened.  Amazon Customer Service is having me send the entire thing back for a refund.  But I still want to tumble rocks.  Not sure what to do.

Can you buy a refill of the gel?  Or is this a one time use?>,descriptive,"I am absolutely mystified why everyone who answered this question gave bad advice.  You CAN refill the farm.  You order new gel from ""antgel.com"" for a few bucks.  It comes with instructions on pouring the new gel into the cleaned out ant farm.  Good as new.

Can you buy a refill of the gel?  Or is this a one time use?>,descriptive,"it's not a one-time use, because you can run water through the tunnels to rinse them out, then add new ants, which will re-populate and further develop the tunnels. we got 3 uses. they may also sell the gel, but that would be difficult - it's probably put in warm or hot and settles into a perfectly clear solid, without a wrinkle or bubble or anything that would upset the view. I can't imagine that doing that from a tube or bottle or whatever would get the same effect.",NA,"[0, 1]",0
Can you buy a refill of the gel?  Or is this a one time use?>,descriptive,It is a one time use. The ants will tunnel continuously and they also consume the gel.

Can anyone tell me what is in Tangoes Jr. that causes it to have the CA Prop 65 warning on the Amazon page?,descriptive,"The CA Prop 65 warning indicates a product contains compounds that could cause cancer, birth defects, or reproductive harm. I typically avoid anything that has that label associated with it. Before this product ever had this label, however, we purchased it for our children. I suspect that the plastic pieces, the magnets sandwiched between the plastic pieces, or even the glossy coating on the pattern cards are things that contain ""less than desirable chemicals"". Now for my most humblest of opinions...practically every toy for sale on amazon and in local stores probably qualify for that label. Whether it contains lead, or BPA, bromide, chloride, etc. Just because a toy doesn't have that warning doesn't mean it doesn't qualify. I looked everywhere on the packaging for this toy for the CA prop 65 warning and didn't find it. Unfortunately, one never truly knows what yucky chemicals are hiding in children's toys. If you want a truly non-toxic toy, you need to stick with unfinished wooden toys. Hopefully change is on the horizon for toy manufacturers.",NA,"[3, 3]",1

Is it BPA free?,descriptive,"I use to ask the manufacturer regarding BPA content, in another product though. I never see FP product that labeled BPA-free before, so I think they may employ similar policy if not the same about BPA contents. Here is their answerThe recent focus of the debate surrounding BPA has been around usage in food contact items. Mattel does not manufacture or sell food contact items, such as baby bottles or sports bottles, and we require our licensees who make such products to use materials that do not contain BPA. In our products, BPA is primarily used to make polycarbonate, where low levels of BPA remain after manufacture. Polycarbonate is an expensive material that is mainly used for its shatterproof properties. In toys, this type of plastic could be used in hard clear pieces, because it is especially strong. Mattel uses polycarbonate in a limited number of toys, and only when a substitute material would compromise safety or quality.",NA,"[5, 5]",1

how does the drill work?,descriptive,"It has three positions: forward, off, and backward. The toy comes with coordinating drill bits. Your child will choose the matching bit for the screw he (or she) is working with. I bought two of these items (a plane and a truck). The drill that came with the airplane stopped working if he pressed it too hard. The drill that came with the truck works even if he presses it into the screw with all his might. I guess the first drill was broken.",NA,"[2, 2]",1
how does the drill work?,descriptive,"On the one that we got, the drill has the three-way switch (my sister purchased it for my daughter's 3rd birthday, which was in March).  We find that the switch does sometimes stick, so you may have to move it a bit to get the drill to switch functions.  (In other words, it's not a precise switch.)  For the plane that we got, all of the bolts are the ""phillips"" type, though we got all three bits (nut driver, flathead, phillips).  We find that the ""phillips"" bit works the best for her -- she can't mess up the placement and get frustrated -- so we just put the other bits away in a drawer.",NA,"[2, 2]",1

Can it be that both are defective, or is there something else I am missing here?I tried putting the batteries in different ways before flipping the on/off switch .. still nothing.  Anyone in the same boat as I am?",descriptive,"Of the three I bought (from Amazon.com), two didn't turn on at all and the third works fine.  Interestingly, the one that works was packaged a little bit differently than the other two.  The one that works had the instruction manual folded in half and secured to the glasses using a piece of plastic-coated wire.  The two that didn't work had the wire in place (holding the glasses to that problematic plastic ""face""), but the manual was just slipped into the bottom of the box.  That difference in packaging makes me wonder whether the two that didn't work might've previously been returned as defective.  Hmmmmmmm.  Could just be coincidence, though.I had some free time yesterday so I did a little troubleshooting on the two that didn't work.  In both cases, the camera wasn't turning on because it wasn't getting power.  One of them had a problem with the battery pack.  The metal clips that conduct between adjacent batteries weren't all properly aligned.  It took a little trial-and-error, but I was able to get them to work by moving the metal clips around until I was getting power to the camera.  To do this, I had to remove the batteries and undo the 4 screws holding the battery pack together.  The metal pieces along the bottom of the battery pack can be moved slightly side-to-side and *carefully* bent upward with a pair of needle-nose pliers.The battery pack on the second one was working properly, but the ground wire (black) wasn't properly soldered to the CCD camera's printed circuit board.  It was only soldered to one side of the board, but it's a two-sided board, so I needed to push the wire all the way through the hole and re-solder it on both sides of the board.  To get access to the CCD camera circuit board, you need to remove the five metal screws inside the goggles and the three metal screws from the camera holder above the goggles.  The whole thing just slides apart then.  The wires from the battery pack to the camera circuit board are yellow, white, and black.  With the power switch ON, you should have about 8 volts between the white and black wires.  Both of my ""defective"" units now work fine.  If you're comfortable fixing electronics and, like me, too lazy to deal with returning things through the mail, then you might try checking the power connections.  This probably *technically* voids the warranty, but whatever.Anyway, I can't say that I'm terribly impressed with the quality control program at EyeClops.",NA,"[3, 3]",1

Is this really 25 pounds?  It seems like free shipping wouldn't cover that much weight,descriptive,"YES! And I did get free shipping. This is so much high quality sand for the price! I was really impressed. I own a daycare and price is an important factor in every purchase. I was expecting to pay twice what I did for sand. I have the Step 2 Sand and Water Activity Table, which holds 20 pounds of sand and 2 gallons of water. I filled the entire thing with the sand from this one purchase. Granted, neither side was filled to capacity, but it was the perfect amount and quite full, I wouldn't have wanted to (and didn't) add anymore. I'm not sure why other responses seem to contradict mine, and maybe they had a different experience, but I was so happy I wrote a review for this sand and seller, which I rarely take the time to do. I feel I should add this: I read some reviews that complained of the high price of shipping. One woman said she received hers in four flat rate shipping boxes, the price of which came out to be half of what she paid for the sand, which is outrageous. My sand came in one box containing two large bags of sand. I'm not sure why the shipping isn't consistent, but you'll know immediately upon ordering if you're shipping cost is too high. You can always cancel your order before it goes through and buy it through another seller. If I were you I'd give it a try though. It's worth it!",NA,"[4, 4]",1

I just eyeballed the drill bit size and wiggle it around a little if the hole is too small. If the hole is too large, glue!

There's no torn pieces, and the colors have held up well. We've had all kinds of toys and chairs/table on it over the years and it's still in good shape.

"Is the action high on this guitar?  In another words, is the string placed way too high above the fret board?  :)  Thank you so much!",descriptive,"The comfortable action is somewhat a personal choice of the player. Moreover, even two guitars with the same model numbers might have a different feel. To my experience Yamaha guitars are quite consistent, and out of the factory they are adjusted with an optimum action for most players. Having bought two of these models myself for my students, I think the action is just right. If the action feels too high on the guitar you have, there might be a defect, the neck might be bent due to extreme weather conditions, or if the guitar is not brand new the saddle might have been replaced...",NA,"[1, 2]",0

Does it charge each battery independently or all together?,descriptive,"Joe:  There are four sockets; each charges independently.  It's recommended that you not leave charged batteries in the charger, but my guess is that's an ""err on the side of safety"" statement.

I wonder how long that will take for a response....long enough to cut out my ability to cancel the order I just placed I'm sure:::",descriptive,"I think there is a lot of mis-understanding about shopping on Amazon.

You have to look for the ""Ships & sold through Amazon""... sometimes you will see it sold through a different name. That person can sell there items for what ever price they feel like it.

An adult may have to assist with some of the more complex projects...and to provide a little enthusiasm before the child gives up!",NA,"[4, 4]",1
How's the build quality?,descriptive,"Good enough for experimentation.  Having components wired into the board prevents loss, and therefore the only things kids are likely to lose are the jumper wires (which are easily replaced).  The board is cardboard, so can't stand up to much abuse, but it's boxed in such a way as to protect the edges.  I would just be careful not to spill anything or drop anything heavy on it.I bought one for myself a few years ago, and ended up giving it to my nephew last year.

This is different than modern, for which most of the cards you pick up here will be legal). But outside of what is/is not legal in specific formats, the reality is that most of the cards here are going to be unplayable. You maybe get a couple good, playable rares, but nothing that you couldn't by as a single for less than a dollar. It's just not worth it. You are mostly paying to ship a bunch of junk cards no one wants. Only good if you like to collect older cards and like to have lots of different cards from different sets - NOT ideal for competitive play or learning the game. So - what do I recommend instead of this if you are looking to learn? Official intro packs are an okay route - they are not the most bang for your buck, but they are easy because it is playable right out of the box, making it a good way to learn how a deck works before trying to build your own. Pick up one of the Journey into Nyx intro packs for around $10-$15 dollars, play around with it, bring it to an event at a local game store and lose a few games. If you decide you want to make something more competitive, check out deck building sites like Tapped Out. They feature some budget decks that you can build by buying singles through sites like Star City Games. There are a couple popular decks that are pretty good that cost under $20. Other decks will be way out of your budget range and can cost upwards of $200 to build from scratch.Another good thing to do is order 4x sets of all commons and uncommons from recently released sets. Magic 2014 is cycling out of standard soon, but the Theros block (theros, born of the gods, and return to nyx sets) will still be legal next year. You can by a complete 4x common/uncommon set for each one for around $25-$30 dollars. You will have a bunch of cards to work with, and better yet, a lot of them will be very good and playable cards. Then you only have to worrying about buying rares for your decks if you are building a set just from Theros. It's a good way to start a well-rounded collection that can be used to build actually competitive decks, as well as having plenty of fun and usable cards for casual play with friends.",NA,"[3, 3]",1
Are these cards usable in tournaments?,descriptive,"to be honest? no. even the rares that you get are fringe rares. i guess you are asking about standard tournaments. if you're a beginning player, a few are possibly usable for FNM, but you will realize that the real good cards are not gonna be in this type of bulk acquisition. this is a good way to start your collection, and just to get some rares that you can practice with. you will never see rares that cost more than a couple of bucks in these. the older cards , and even some of the new cards, that you will get here will maybe find good use in Commander decks, but that's it. if you want to be a serious tournament player, just trade for the pricey cards that your decks really need. i once traded 40 rares to get Liliana from Innistrad block. just saying. if you really need a card, the best way is to trade for them.",NA,"[6, 8]",0

InnoTab FAQs by KBarrett...Q1 - What do I need to download games, e-books, or transfer Music and Pictures?A - You'll need an SD Card (8GB or larger) and goes in the battery compartment.  You'll also want an AC Adapter.  Connect the USB chord to your PC and install the Learning Lodge Navigator (LLN) software.Q2 - How do I register my child's InnoTab in the LLN software?A - Click on the Image of the InnoTab and choose Add Child.  Fill out all fields to complete registration.Q3 - How do I register more than 1 InnoTab in the LLN?A - Click on each individual InnoTab image and choose Add Child.  DO NOT add children in the My Account section.  It will not retain your child's information!!!Q4 - How many V Coins do I get when I register my InnoTab and what do I get for them?A - You get 3 V Coins per InnoTab you register.  Each V Coin is worth $2.99, which will give you 3 free Games or E-Books.Q5 - How many programs are there available to download?A - There are 80 applications (as of 12/28/11).  90% of those are $2.99, with the rest costing $4.99.Q6 - Where do I go to find the Games and E-Books and Transfer them to my InnoTab?A - You MUST click on the image of the InnoTab once connected to your PC.  DO NOT use the Downloads tab along the top!!!  Once you have clicked on the image, you will see a Menu down the Left side of the screen. Click on the ""Learning Apps Download Center"".  Select the Games/E-Books you'd like to buy with V Coins and/or Credit Card or PayPal.  Download the apps and then Transfer them to your InnoTab.Q7 - Can I access the Games/E-Books that I've downloaded previously?A - Yes.  Click on the image of your InnoTab to access the Menu down the Left side of the screen.  Click on ""My Downloads"".  You will see all the software programs you've downloaded and if the program(s) haven't been transferred yet to your InnoTab, you'll see check boxes next to each program.  Select the check box you want and click Transfer.Q8 - What format does Music have to be in?A - Songs must be in .MP3 format and be free of DRM protection.  Google search for DRM removal programs like TuneBite or SoundTaxi.Q9 - How do I transfer Music to my InnoTab?A - Click on the image of your InnoTab to access the Menu down the Left side of the screen and select ""File Manager"".  Then choose the Music tab.  Navigate to the folder where your music is stored, which will auto-populate the LLN with all the songs in that folder.  Check the checkbox next to each song you want transferred and click the Transfer button.  You can keep selecting songs as you scroll down the list and then Transfer in one click.Q10 - How do I transfer Pictures to my InnoTab?A - Use the same directions as Music, except select the Pictures Tab instead of Music.Q11 - How do I transfer full length Movies to my InnoTab?A - First ""rip"" your movie to a folder on your PC.  I use DVDFab.  Also only select ""Main Movie"" before ripping.  Then you'll need to convert the movie to an acceptable format (.AVI).  Get FreeMake Video Converter and use the following steps and settings:Step 1 - Once installed, open the program and click the +Video button. Step 2 - Navigate to where your movie folder is and select all files in the folder and click the Open button. Step 3 - On the bottom of the program select the ""to AVI"" button. Step 4 - Click the blue sprocket or ""Edit Settings"". Step 5 - Choose the following settings: (Videos display perfectly using these settings) Frame Size = Custom, Width = 512, Height = 320, Adjustment = Auto, Video Codec = XVID, Frame Rate = 29.97 fps, Bitrate = Auto Audio Codec = MP3, Channels = Stereo, Sample Rate = 44100 Hz, Bitrate = 128 Kbps. Step 6 - Give the new Setting a Title like ""InnoTab Settings"" and click OK. Step 7 - Choose where to save the finished AVI file. Step 8 - Click Convert.Finally, you can either close the Learning Lodge program and navigate to the new Drive on your PC, which is the SD Card (varies by computer) or you can take the SD card out and place it in an SD Card Reader (faster transfer speeds than through the InnoTab). Once you navigate to the SD Card on your computer, go to the LLN folder and inside you'll see a number of folders. Open the Movies folder and simply drag-and-drop the AVI file you made with the FreeMaker program into the Movies Folder on the SD Card. Once done, put the SD Card back in the InnoTab and turn it on, or restart the InnoTab for it to recognize the new movie.Q12 - How long do Batteries last?A - There are many reports that 4 AA batteries will only last a few hours.  It is recommended that you purchase an AC Adapter.Q13 - Why does the InnoTab keep requesting to update the Date and Time?A - The InnoTab has a very limited internal battery to maintain the Date and Time.  If the batteries wear out or it is unplugged from the AC Adapter for a long period of time, it resets the internal clock.  It is best to keep the InnoTab plugged in and/or batteries are replaced as soon as they wear down.Q14 - Can you use rechargeable batteries in the InnoTab?A - Yes.  Though you'll want 8 batteries, 4 of inside the InnoTab and 4 in the charger at all times, unless using the AC Adapter.Q15 - Can the InnoTab recharge batteries?A - No.Q16 - Is there an Alarm Clock included with the InnoTab?A - No.  The original press release stated that it would include an Alarm Clock, however, there is not one.  Maybe with a future Firmware update, but not keeping my hopes up.Q17 - Is there an update for the InnoTab?A - Yes.  In the LLN, click on the InnoTab image and on the Menu down the left side of the screen, click on ""Update InnoTab"".  Follow the prompts and choose to Update InnoTab.  The latest Firmware version is 6.10914 as of 12/28/11.Q18 - Where do I access the Games/E-Books that I've downloaded to the InnoTab?A - On the InnoTab, click on the Downloads icon, at the bottom will have the Games, E-Books and Other options.Q19 - How do I track my Child's Progress?A - You MUST click on the InnoTab image first, or see the Menu down the leftside!  Then click on the ""Progress Log"" on the Top Menu bar.Q20 - The LLN keeps saying I need Flash Player.  How do I get Flash to install correctly?A -  Uninstall your Flash Player then open the LLN program.  When it asks you if you want to install Adobe hit ""Yes"", pick the windows 7 32bit, then on the browser question DO NOT put in Internet Explorer, instead choose ""Other Browsers"".Q21 - How do you know so much about Swallows?A - You've got to know these things to be King.I hope this InnoTab FAQs was of some use.  Please let me know if it was.Thanks!",NA,"[5, 5]",1

is the zipper hard to zip? is it good quality?  is amazon the cheapest way to get this? and can American girl doll's fit in it?,descriptive,"The zipper is very easy to zip. My 7 yr. old granddaughter can zip and unzip the case by herself. I found the case to be of very good quality. It's a very heavy canvas material and the stitching is done neatly and secure.

Wondering about the durability of this dollhouse?   Ok for a 2-3 year old?

The house itself is pretty durable, but things like the windows and doors are, frankly, flimsier than I would like. For the price of the house, I was a bit surprised at this. My daughter is very gentle with her toys, but I felt even for her I had to remind her, please play gently. The furniture is pretty durable overall, but again, for the price of this stuff, some of it is shoddy. The tub faucet broke off in about 5 minutes and the legs on the chairs are really thin and I feel like could snap in a minute.

The house is made from a plastic mterial and feels flimsy but seems to be holding up well. Many of the accessories we purchased, like the white and gold bedroom set and some of the lamps, were too fragile for her and she broke them rather quickly.

How does this play with four players?,descriptive,"I've only played 2 player, so far, but on the basis of that experience, I'd anticipate a fairly good deal of down time between turns.  In 2 player, the active player takes most of the actions on his turn, though the other player is the only possible target, should any combat occur, so usually the second player will end up with something to do.  However, with four players, there's only a 33.3% chance that any particular player will be engaged by the active player, and combat isn't all that common, so there's a good chance that each player would have some downtiime between turns.  Of course, this can be an advantage as it allows for  snack breaks and so forth without necessarily disrupting the game in progress.Again, this is a purely speculative reply, so chances are your experience will vary.",NA,"[1, 2]",0

Can this be used indoors?,descriptive,"If you want to use it indoors you will need a space big enough for it to rotate all the way around without hitting anything.

You will definitely want to buy a few more books.

My daughter has the fun loving grand doll house what is the difference? Is there more room vs the old one?,descriptive,"In the Grand dollhouse there are fewer rooms (one on each level) but they are larger.  The Dream dollhouse has three smaller rooms on each level (the sizes vary but they are all about 6-8"" deep and 6-9"" wide).  The Grand dollhouse has an attic (fourth level) that spans the house, but is considerably shorter, while the Dream dollhouse has a collapsible fourth level that is only one room wide.  They both have side wings that fold out, but on the dream dollhouse, one of those wings is a staircase with a small ""secret"" closet underneath (that's my daughter's favorite part) instead of rooms.  And the other wing has two levels, but the bottom level doesn't have a floor surface like the Grand dollhouse.  The Dream dollhouse also has a built-in bathroom (you cannot move the toilet and vanity) but the toilet has a flushing sound, and the vanity lights turn on and off.  There are also two sound buttons on the house that play three songs (Happy Birthday, Lullaby, and some sort of salsa dance music) and play random house noises (doorbell, telephone, grandfather clock chimes, baby laughing, dog barking).  The Dream dollhouse has more neat features, but the Grand dollhouse probably has more room.  I find Loving Family furniture is probably designed for the larger rooms of the Grand dollhouse.  All the pieces do not fit in the smaller Dream dollhouse rooms, although there are more rooms.  Personally I like the Dream dollhouse better.",NA,"[11, 11]",1

age range,descriptive,"We purchased this train for our 3 year old grandson's 3rd. birthday. We had it sent to his home in New England and it arrived the day before we got there for the celebration. It was very well packaged and everything was in great working order. It is a sturdy little train, stayed on the tracks and functioned well in all aspects. The child was thrilled and loved pushing the different bells and whistles on the remote. He had no trouble operating it and played with it for 30 - 40 min. at a time before he would get distracted and then he would be right back to run Thomas. It was a perfect gift. Of course he is train crazy and hyper focused on anything to do with trains. We did put the remote and cars up when we were not nearby to supervise as he is probably still too young to leave unattended with such an expensive toy.  He loved being able to pull the tops off of the box cars and putting other toys in them to take a ride. He will get many years of use out of this toy and can add track and other cars and engines as he grows older and out grows Thomas. We were well please and highly recommend this train.",NA,"[3, 3]",1

So the pieces themselves would not be a choking hazard. However, one caveat. Our grandson built a structure on a table in a sunroom where the floor was ceramic tile.  His building was knocked off the table onto the tile floor, and one of the pieces ""popped"" open. The building tile itself was not broken but the two sides came apart and the six little magnets inside were scattered. Those narrow little magnets, 3/4 inch long, would definitely be a bad choking hazard for a baby or small child.   The building tile was not broken. We were able to re-insert the magnets and press the two sides of the tile back together, but I threw that tile away in case it had been weakened. I alerted all our eight grandchildren's parents. It has never happened again. Kids' buildings have been knocked down constantly but always on wooden floors and there has been no further problem. Overall, it has been a fabulous toy.

Will this expansion let you play with more than 4 people?,descriptive,"Hi John,The reason the game only goes up to 4 players has to do with the fact that, with 4 players going before you, you really do not have much control over the game and therefore it is less a game about strategy and more a game about trying not to play any minions so that the bases do not score before your next turn. It creates for gridlock and an all-around frustrating game. This expansion does not change the game itself, it only adds more options for players when selecting their two factions. So no, this is still a 2-4 player game.You can try playing with 5 if you care to, but it will likely not be as fun. Hope that helps!",NA,"[3, 3]",1

I have had to replace the tail rotor motor and the plastic connector for the main motor on the radio board melted   I have given up back to back flights  as a side note the batteries take a good hour to charge after they cool down   still the 913 is an order of magnitude more fun to fly than the 911  very fast  flight quick turns  it is an outdoor machine   to big and fast for indoor  it will handle a light breeze  great fun,NA,"[4, 4]",1

Just a snap to change the battery.  There is a battery strap with 2 screws that I no longer use since canopy alone secures the battery safe enough for me.  The V913 is a good bird.  After you get a few hours flying time in, move the servo linkages to the last hole in the servo arms.  Dramatically improves the performance.  For spare parts I recommend techNtoys at Amazon.  Good luck!",NA,"[4, 4]",1

I removed the screws and plastic strap over the battery of the v913, and placed Velcro on the battery as well as the base of the copter where the battery goes. That way you can pull them in and out when you remove the canopy. Only problem is, the stock motors of the v913 run very hot, so I wouldn't recommend running 2 batteries back to back.

I received the V913 the other day.  It came with a bad battery.  How long has the product been on the market?,descriptive,I think its been on the market maybe a year and a half to two years I'm not really sure but if your going to be playing with the larger rc toys you may want to get you a good balance charger I have a imax-B6 I got from Tmart.com you can get your batteries cheap too. The balance charger will make your batteries last a lot longer befor with the charger that comes with these rc toys I was only getting 18 or so charges from each battery I have 40 or so on some and still going with the balance charger. but back to you battery trouble it very well could have sit in a warehouse and the battery went bad. Tmart and Banggood.com are good places to buy from all these rc toys come from china anyway Banggood packs better when shipping than tmart but tmart has a lot of parts and things in U.S. warehouse's and you get them sooner if you order from them Use PayPal like amazon if you have any trouble they stand behind you.,NA,"[2, 2]",1

Once the game begins and your piece is hit, there is a voice activator that says so, when your ship is destroyed it says your battleship has be destroyed. My grandson (7 years old) could not call out the coordinates for the old battleship. We can play against the computer together on the new one, or someone else can put the coordinates in and then he can play the remainder of the game himself. So there is more versatility with the new electronic game. I spent hours playing the old game with my son and brother and loved it.",NA,"[2, 2]",1

"is this machine ""chinese toy quality"" or ""american hobby quality"" and is that why is it is so highly-rated  here on amazon?",descriptive,"This helicopter will break if you treat it poorly, just like anything else.  It's not a kids toy, it's a decent RC helicopter suitable for flying indoors in a small amount of space.  I've had mine for a few months and have had a blast flying it, but this isn't my first and I try not to hit things with it. Accidents do occasionally happen and I haven't had one problem with it, even with what I expected to be flight ending crashes.  It's amazingly light and is made from resilient plastic.  I keep mine in its original box when not flying and keep the batteries charged (I have three).If you understand RC helicopters and want to have one that is inside only and can jump around your living room, then this is for you.  If you want a decent beginners heli and understand that if you crash it, you will break it sooner or later, this is for you.  If you want to bash it into things, you get what you deserve.

Horizon Hobby also supports this product line and their customer service is exceptional.

I have 3 Blade helicopters and I find the quality to be as good as anything I've come across. The Nano qx is really fun to fly. It's stable and I fly it in the house sometimes. It can take a bit of a beating because it's so light. Because of the small motors, I limit the flight time to about 8 minutes and let it cool down. I have about 4 hours of flight time on the Nano qx and haven't had any trouble. Hope this helps with your decision.",NA,"[2, 2]",1
"is this a ""easy for beginner"" aircraft?",yesno,"It depends on your definition of ""Easy""If you want  to take it out of box, pop in batteries and just fly it around like a pro, then no, this isn't easy. However, the Nano QX is light weight and takes more abuse than most other aircraft. So if you're a beginner crashing it will not destroy it. The Nano QX is very user friendly - so learning how to fly is made much easier, BUT- you will need practice to fly the Nano QX. I just purchased one for a beginner because 1. It does take abuse well. In other words you can crash it- and it will survive. And 2. You do need to develop real skills to fly it (which is half the fun anyway) and those skills will take you to bigger and more advanced aircraft. So bottom line is this - Nano QX is great choice for beginners who want to learn how to really fly. It will not fly itself, you will develop real flying skills.",NA,"[2, 2]",1

"What is the maximum useful altitude?

The company that makes the toy said that they thought that it would work fine but I was not impressed by the manager I spoke with.  I believe that he was just guessing without having any real proof.

"What is the maximum useful altitude? We live at 7,500 feet and most flying toys do not work properly",descriptive,"I am assuming the previous toys were airplanes.  The thinner air at 7500 ft will require toy airplanes to fly faster to maintain its altitude and their control surfaces (elevator, ailerons ...) to increase the angles of operation to be able to maneuver the airplane.  If the airplane cannot meet these increased rates then it will not work.  As for the quadcopters, the increase in altitude will require the four blades to spin faster, something it can easily do.  The quadcopter does not rely on its body for lift like an airplane does, so at that altitude it should work fine.  What I do expect is the performance in maneuvering the quadcopter should decrease.  By this I mean the response to a given command.  To conclude, I believe if you care about making it hover and moving it steadily about you should be fine.  If you are looking to do flips with it and crazy aerial maneuvers it will not work because it will probably crash.  I hope this sheds some light.",NA,"[1, 2]",0

I am going to use this for quads.  What receiver would you recommend?  I will want something that I can add additional modes such as return and others,descriptive,"Hi Ben For long range flights on a quad, the most important thing is your propeller and motor setup.  Optimal flights should not consume more than 11 amps while in flight.  Also a definite must is a prop balancer to avoid vibration, this in turn will affect your video quality (Jello affect). As for equipment: I recommend the following: 1. NAZA -M Lite (this has several flight modes: manual, Attitude, GPS and of course RTH (Return to Home)2. EZOSD - This will feed you all the Telemetry reading that are happening with you Quad.  You will see the info if you are using goggles or a screen. For short flights I would recommend a Spektrum DX9 control and a AR600 receiver.  This setup  should give you like a mile of control. If you are planning to do long range flights, then you should use Dragonlink.  You will have a flying distance of about 25 miles. For FPV, I'm currently using 5.8Ghz video.  For antennas I use IBCrazy ultras to transmit and Helical 5 turn on the receiving end. Well Ben I hope this info is of use. Visit my website or email.  www.fpvcartel.com Good luck to ya!",NA,"[3, 3]",1

I am going to use this for quads.  What receiver would you recommend?  I will want something that I can add additional modes such as return and others,descriptive,"Ben,With a Spektrum AR8000 receiver, you will be able to control a multirotor more than adequately. I have programmed the DX9 using Naza-M Lite to be able to fly in GPS, Attitude, and Manual modes. While in each of the modes, hitting the Hold switch will automatically engage Return to Home and Land. In addition, I have assigned another switch to select Normal, Course Lock, and Home Lock modes (while in GPS flight mode, of course).The extra channels on AR8000 can be used to control your gimbal (tilt and roll), if you wish. Get the DX9 for the multirotor. You will not regret it.",NA,"[2, 2]",1

This is a generalization, of course, but that's about the youngest that played with it and had any interest.  The box lists choking hazards for children under 3 so we didn't have those children at do it.  My 8 year old daughter actually got very good at this and wound up helping the younger ones.

"When closed completely, will the cover keep critters out?  Is the ""roof"" hard or just overlapping mesh?  How does this product hold up overtime?",descriptive,"I'm not sure how the fabric will hold up overtime.  It seems like quality outdoor fabric.  The top is fabric that is stretched over wooden railing and held down with heavy duty snaps.  I strung tiny Christmas lights through the railings to light it up at night.  The base of each flap has a wooden dowel that holds the fabric down but it does move around when the win blows.  You can hear the dowels tap on the sandbox base.  I built it for my grandkids.  My daughter was concerned about critters as well, she has many animals that wander her yard at night.  What I did was staple gun the three sides down that are shown in the photo.  She decided that she would not worry about rolling up these sides, only the front.  The front I added strips of velcro that I stapled to the fabric and staple gunned to the wood.  This keeps the front piece from flapping in the wind and seems secure from critters.  My daughter feels content that these adjustments should help in reducing issues with animals.  I hope this information helps.  It seems to be a quality sandbox.  I was very happy with how it turned out.",NA,"[0, 1]",0
"Is it possible to combine this game with one of the previous ones (Ravenloft and Ashardalon) to have more people play, more monsters and more item?",descriptive,"Yes, Ravenloft, Ashardalon, and Drizzt are all interchangeable. You can use heroes from any box set with scenarios from any set, etc. What you'll find is Ravenloft was the 1st and honestly considered HARD to beat, Ashardalon came out and was a little easier/balanced. Then Drizzt came out and I find Drizzt to be a VERY powerful hero (as he should be). But I began to notice power creep where the newer games were stronger. In fact there's 3 specific heroes in Drizzt as a team that almost make the missions EZ mode. I still love it, so I mix it up with different monsters and such. As to bringing in more people. I'm not sure if there are special rules to go beyond the base 5 player max, but something might be out there. Btw, we did play with 6 players with just the Drizzt box, and it worked fine. Just not designed on the box like that though.",NA,"[5, 5]",1
"Is it possible to combine this game with one of the previous ones (Ravenloft and Ashardalon) to have more people play, more monsters and more item?",descriptive,"If you get the other games, you can then combine different pieces, and board pieces to change up the game. You can also just have a continuation of a dungeon after you complete the first one. I have played the Drizzt version and its fun. You win sometimes and you lose sometimes, it easy to setup and follow the rules.

how is game played,descriptive,"It's more of a conversation starter then a game. I highly recommend this for all ages. I used it from kindergarten to fifth grade in teaching. Then with my older nieces and nephews. It can ask questions like, what books do you like, where would you want to travel, if you could make up a planet to live on what would it have, tell me about your best friend, etc. imaginative and thought provoking questions.

Can this be played enjoyably with just two people?,descriptive,"Totally. Only one detective is absolutely necessary. It makes the game more difficult for both players though.

With a 3s Lipo battery we'll over 65mph too crazy to drive able to do straight runs only (cost $40.00). This buggy's parts are as good as the 1/8 scale Team Losi Racing 8ight 3.0 and the Team Durango Dex408.

She loves playing with it but is too young to understand that the bills & coins aren't just fun pieces of paper/circular objects to play with.

I would definitely recommend it!",NA,"[2, 2]",1
What is the difference between sequence and Delux sequence?,descriptive,The Delux comes with the cushioned play mat and reversible crowning chips. The mat is not as large as the jumbo version but better than the standard sequence cardboard game board.

What is the difference between sequence and Delux sequence?,descriptive,"Sorry, I'm not sure. I believe the game is the same.

"From my understanding, they write out answers. So, if I play with people I know well, wouldn't I know who wrote what just by the handwriting?",descriptive,"I was confused by this at first too.  The way the game works is that the person to the right or left of the ""guesser"" is the person who collects the answers and reads them aloud for everyone to hear. Then the ""guesser"" has to choose which answer belongs to which person.  In short answer, the person doesn't actually see the answers, just hears them.  If you're good at reading body language, or your friends have horrible poker faces (like me), it might not be as difficult to guess.

Lights need to be lit or battery is not working.  I took my battery to a Batteries Plus( Battery store) and had it tested.  I ended up buying a new battery for $36 and now the train works great.  The train was made by Peg Perego for Learning Curve and they have information about the batteries but I was able to get mine at the battery store. Good Luck! Peg Perego was very helpful with info on this train. They have a website pegpergousa.com and toll free number 18007282108,NA,"[2, 2]",1

Which game would you prefer? The original or the Europe version?,descriptive,No question about it.  The European game is far richer and more nuanced (because of the varied geography).  The US one is more monotone; get the European version.,NA,"[11, 11]",1
Which game would you prefer? The original or the Europe version?,descriptive,"If you haven't played before, I would start with the original. It's much easier to understand. Once you have the hang of that or get bored with USA plus expansion pack, then switch to Europe!",NA,"[4, 4]",1
Which game would you prefer? The original or the Europe version?,descriptive,"They are quite different. We like and play them both often. Ticket Germany is different still. I'd have to say that Ticket USA is the most straightforward - build your railroads, get the longest route. Europe has some accommodations because Europe is so crowded, so you need to learn to deal with stations, tunnels, and ferries. Germany adds passengers and you get nothing for longest route. Those are the ones we've played so far, and it is fun to see how diverse they are.",NA,"[8, 8]",1
Which game would you prefer? The original or the Europe version?,descriptive,"The original is really fun and goes a bit faster. The Europe version is slower and longer but there are some fun variances. If you have younger family members wanting to play with the group, the original is best. We had a 9 year old playing and she learned so much. The Europe version has the names in the native tongue so most of us had to really look around to play. Once you are good at the original the Europe version is more challenging and has more play potential. It does depend on your groups age and knowledge of the world. I like both but am new to the game. I am like my father and can learn quickly and use great strategy so I do like both with the Europe game up for a challenge. We had a party and had two tables going, one of each. The original went two rounds to Europe's one game. I hope this helps.",NA,"[10, 11]",0
Which game would you prefer? The original or the Europe version?,descriptive,Europe. We bought original and then played Europe shortly thereafter. There is an extra element if strategy in that u can have train stations and there are a couple of really high point value train that makes it a lot more fun and challenging,NA,"[5, 5]",1
Which game would you prefer? The original or the Europe version?,descriptive,"If you are new to the game, or not someone who plays many games, the USA version is better to start with. It is very simple. In the Europe version, there are tunnels and ferries that require you to have the locomotive (wild) cards, or take a risk to build on a tunnel. I learned to play Europe first and received USA for Christmas. The strategy is very different. If you have kids or grandparents playing, go for USA. But if you want more of a challenge, get Europe. I am planning to get Europe too so that we have both. That way if we have friends over who haven't played, we can do USA. But the usual group would probably play Europe more because it is a bit more challenging. Both great games!",NA,"[5, 5]",1
Which game would you prefer? The original or the Europe version?,descriptive,"I looked at the board pictures online and they all look pretty tame and boring compared to TTR-Europe.  The central section of the Eastern side of the board is similar to the other game board options (Asia, Africa, the Original), with long stretches, few double tracks, and not much use of locomotives or tunnels to lay tracks.  Europe is by far the best.",NA,"[4, 4]",1
Which game would you prefer? The original or the Europe version?,descriptive,"Europe especially if casual gamers are going to be involved. It is the least competitive and therefore more enjoyable for me and most involved. Of course, if you prefer that in your games get the other or the 3-player Nordic Countries.",NA,"[2, 3]",0
Which game would you prefer? The original or the Europe version?,descriptive,"I own Europe and Asia.  My daughter owns the US version.  They are both equally fun.   The US version has more routes.  The Europe version has tunnels and ferries.  I would base my decision on which one to get based on who would be playing.  The US version, for some, would be easier due to a background in US geography.",NA,"[2, 3]",0

Would the game board be considered an accurate map? I want to use it to help prepare students for the National Geographic Bee.,descriptive,"No, it is not accurate, per se because to get all the tracks in the map, I'm sure, it had to be modified for the game.  It's still a good map, IMO.  The  cities are not in a English spelling manner though.  I liked that because I had to look some of them up in the Dictionary.",NA,"[0, 1]",0
How is ticket to Ride Europe different than the United  States  board game?,descriptive,You mean other than it being Europe rather than the United States? There are routes that are designated at tunnels that could potentially cost more car cards to claim than initially shown. There are also routes that are ferries (a line that travels across water. ie Amsterdam to London) which require locomotive cards to claim.,NA,"[3, 3]",1
How is ticket to Ride Europe different than the United  States  board game?,descriptive,"Europe in my opinion is a better map. The map is well spread-out and has a bunch of ""long-routes"". The USA map is a little skewed and the concentration of cities in not evenly spread.",NA,"[3, 3]",1
How is ticket to Ride Europe different than the United  States  board game?,descriptive,"According to my grandkids, Europe version is a little more complicated, with ferries, train stations, and tunnels added to the mix.  Hope this helps.",NA,"[3, 3]",1
How is ticket to Ride Europe different than the United  States  board game?,descriptive,"The European version has its routes a little more crowded in spots, but the biggest difference comes from two features not present in the American version: Rail Stations and Tunnels. These features add a layer of complexity. They don't make it any better or worse, just different. My family isn't a big fan of these additions to the rules.",NA,"[2, 2]",1

youngest age for Mindstorms NXT? How young can you start a child on this toy?,descriptive,"Sorry for the late reply, Mark. I just got here myself. Your question allows all sorts of answers each containing a question itself. Of course the usual admonition about small children and small parts applies. You should also avoid leaving Lego models constructed by older children (or adults) around for discovery and play by those young children who might choke trying to eat any of the smaller parts.You knew that already? OK, if the child you have in mind has already been using and assembling Lego models, notably the Technic themed ones, the NXT set may be an amazing extension of that activity. Particularly if that child has re-combined any or all of those previous sets into some other, non-supplied model configuration. That is, did s/he build something of his/her own design from the Technic pieces.The use of a computer is required to get the best use of the NXT machines being made. If your candidate  does not know how to use or have access to a personal computer, the whole NXT experience will be severely limited. Even if your youngster has quite a bit of computer experience, it will be of benefit to receive some adult guidance to insure that all the suggested installation and operation topics are understood and followed. It will prevent a great deal of frustration to do so since the programming environment is not particularly intuitive to a beginner. It's easy to do, but not as intuitive as the Lego bricks as using them goes.You notice I didn't mention any specific ages, such as found on the actual boxes. I'm not convinced that everyone is being totally objective about those numbers in the first place. The vendor wants a lower number to intice more sales, but the parent wants to think of his precocious 9-year-old as actually able to do 11-year-old rated activities. AFAIK, there's no regulation associated with ages printed on any toys. If you are looking for something that will keep your kid busy in your absence, this may do it, but you'll need to prime the pump a bit to generate interest.Amazingly enough, my recommendation is to buy the NXT for yourself, set it up, build and use it yourself without mentioning it (yeah right?) to the kid. When the child(ren) in question come to you to ask questions about what you're doing, you will be ready to be their local expert and have some ready-built models to demonstrate the inevitable fun. However, be prepared to turn over the set to the child once sufficient interest an curiosity has been fostered. Or more likely, be prepared to buy ANOTHER set so you can both make robots. Perhaps even to battle each other. arrrrggggghhhhh! take that you evil dinosaurus!   Good luck.   billb",NA,"[14, 17]",0
youngest age for Mindstorms NXT? How young can you start a child on this toy?,descriptive,"Hey billb - That's the best response I've read regarding age-appropriateness of this product! Gee, why didn't it occur to me to get it for myself (since I'm the one who really wants to try it out....) I want to add a little info to the discussion that I received from Lego Education. They are coming out wit a product in Jan. 2009 that meets the need of the kids who love to build crazy contraptions (similar to the Klutz book - who by the way, just came out with a new Lego contraptions book, oh, I digress....). Anyway, it is a beginner robotics for those aged 10 and under! I just went to the LegoEducation web site but couldn't find it -sorry. I don't know why we don't hear more about the LegoEducation.com web site and all the cool products they have to offer. They DO sell to the public and will send out a catalog to you.

LEGO has been building innovative kits like these for years, and this is how well they have evolved while others have fallen by the wayside.

"Why won't Amazon Let Me Sell MINE? Whenever I try to list my Elmo, it says I can't because its on a list of restricted items. Why is that?",descriptive,"Yes it has. First of all, their ""Help"" page is not very helpful. Second, they try to hide their ""contact customer service"" form. They try to get you to solve the problem on your own by clicking on a series of links. But if you keep clicking the link that says ""no, I did not find the answer to my questions on this page"" link, it sends you around in circles. I finally found a place where I can send an email to customer service to Amazon. I wanted to know why my order simply went missing. It would have been nice if Amazon told me my order was cancelled or was still back-ordered. But no, they simply deleted my order from my ""Open and Recently Shipped"" page. Their reply was that the item is scarce and my order is back-ordered and that I should check ""Open nand Recently Shipped"" page. I do. My order is still missing. So I email them again by clicking the ""no, this email did not answer my question link."" They said it was a technical error that caused my order to go missing. But they seem to know that it was TMX Elmo just based on my order number so it gives the hint that they do have my order in their database somewhere. Nowhere did I mention that my order was for TMX Elmo. They are lying to us.They told me within 2-3 days, a technical service agent would email me about my order. Never happened. I wait 4 days. So then I email them back. They tell me the same thing: ""your TMX Elmo order is backordered."" Again, how do they know I ordered TMX Elmo based on my order number if my order seems to have gone missing?I reply by clicking ""this email did not help."" I reply: ""Yes, youv'e told me it is backordered. I already know that. That wasn't my concern. My concern is why has my backordered order gone missing? I'd like my order record to be placed back onto my OPEN AND RECENTLY SHIPPED page of my account.

GREED....IT'S AN UGLY THING.",descriptive,"Sorry, but for a large number of parents, your argument just doesn't fly.  Quite a few parents don't get vacation time.  Or perhaps they can't take time off on a particular day.  You say that people make tons of money, so they can afford to pay these ridiculously inflated prices if they really want to get their hands on the toy.  Sure, that's true of some people.  But the vast majority of people cannot afford to pay outrageous big bucks for such a toy, nor can they spend hours on end waiting in line to buy it or dialing every store in town, getting laughed at by sales people for even asking.  They're too busy supporting their families and actually caring for their children to do so.  It is the children from these families who suffer the consequences.One other thing--from what I've read, TMX Elmo is not intended to be a collector's item or limited edition toy.  It does take longer to make than some other toys, because it is more complicated tech-wise.  The real reason that this toy is unavailable is because certain greedy individuals went out to the stores and hoarded them up.  They've created the shortage and now they seek to profit from it.  I've even seen people selling the secrets they use to buy the product up ""before the general public can get it"".  This tactic is immoral and unscrupulous.  Parents, grandparents and others who care about children are not whining when they complain about this.  They have a valid point and a right to be treated with respect as they voice it.",NA,"[4, 6]",0

We can't seem to setup the board. It seems as though boarders are missing. How many boarders are there?  Help would be appreciated.,descriptive,"Keep in mind that you have to use the borders from the original Settlers of Catan pack.  Typically, you'll need to use the 2 funny-shaped  Seafarers border pieces that display the sheep and wood on them.  Those always go at the top and the bottom of the board.  Then, you use all 6 of the long original border pieces from Catan, but turned upside down.  They usually don't fit perfectly, it's trial and error to figure which ones will fit together.  Besides all those pieces, you sometimes need to use the extra small border pieces provided with Seafarers.  These are the pieces that look to be one third of the size of the original Settlers borders.  It is possible that your game did not come with all the pieces.  We ordered an expansion of Catan once from Amazon and some of the pieces were missing.  We called customer service, they paid for the return shipping and they shipped us a new copy of the game.

What's the difference between the American and the Chinese version?,descriptive,The rules are different and some of the tiles are different.  American Mah Jongg uses a card (issued yearly) by the National Mah Jongg League (you can find their website online).  I bought a book on Amazon -- A Beginner's Guide to American Mah Jongg -- which provided a good description of American Mah Jongg and good instruction on American Mah Jongg play.  The hands in Chinese Mahj are different and the quantities of some of the tiles are different.  If you're playing in the US most people are playing American Mahj.,NA,"[3, 3]",1
What's the difference between the American and the Chinese version?,descriptive,There are around forty known mah-jongg variants - and more than a dozen Chinese variants!  Those other variants are not harder to learn than American mah-jongg. American is the hardest to learn of them all. American mah-jongg is hard because you can only play the hands listed on the current year's card (purchased through the National Mah Jongg League). It's quite a challenge to find possibilities for hands from among a random 13 or 14 tiles. Only American mah-jongg uses this annually changing card! All the other forms of mah-jongg are free-form (very much akin to Rummy).,NA,"[2, 2]",1

where can i get instructions to play mah jong with kards,descriptive,I bought two books on line called American Mahjong for Beginners and Strategies of Mahjong on line. Part of the problem is that there are the chinese cards mixed in with the American version which need to be sorted out. I use the cards when traveling because the mahjong set I own is cumbersome and expensive. I would imagine you could download directions on line for the tile game and directions for mahjong. You are correct in that instructions for the cards would have been good.,NA,"[0, 1]",0
where r the instructions,descriptive,"You may be able to find a book on mah jongg at your local library, which will give detailed instruction.  It is also possible to download instructions from the internet by doing a search for ""rules for American mah jongg.""  Be sure to specify American mah jongg, because the Chinese rules are very different.",NA,"[0, 1]",0

I've gone back and forth several times looking over the specifications of each and this is my personal conclusion.I am getting the Leapster Explorer because:The screen area is larger on the ExplorerThe Fisher Price ixl does not have charging stand availableThe ixl doesn't have a program like Learning Path for the Explorer.  The device doesn't aid parents in tracking kids progress very well. Due to the construction of the ixl, the Explorer is built to last a lot longer.  The flip top on the ixl looks much too easy to break off.Well, that's my opinion....  Good luck to all of you.",NA,"[10, 10]",1

UNTIL my 4 year old tried each system at the store. the iXL was much more intuitive for her and the touch screen was more sensitive. The sylus on the explorer has a 'button' at the tip which makes the use of the stylus more difficult for someone just learning how to write. So in the end we flipped our decision and have gone with the iXL to save her the frustration!!",NA,"[7, 7]",1
"Fisher Price ixl VS Leapster Explorer Which one is the better choice? As I've read reviews for both, I still cant quite decide. They both seem to both have about same number of good and bad reviews. So Im still at a toss up between the two.",descriptive,"I know this is really late for some of you but in case there are future people looking.  I went through this about 2 yrs ago when my daughter was 3 and went with the leapfrog explorer. BEST descision I made.  Customer service was amazing!  This past summer my son dunked hers in the water, totally his fault and out of warranty- they replaced it for free!  Since then we have bought a second one for my son (who doesn't dunk it anymore) who has some special needs and it is AMAZING for him.  I don't have any ads on either of ours as stated above, so I'm not sure what that is.  There is a section that is the ""trailers"" and it gives you previews of other games, but you have to actually go into that section not into a game.  It's been wonderful having so many choices to expand to for both my kids, they are 5yr and 3 yr and actually my 16month old gets a hold of it and is amazing at what he is trying to do on it also.  Leapfrog is amazing in their ""computer technology"" in their learning toys and keep all my kids attention way more than other learning toys.  We have used their customer service for other toys and are just as fast and helpful for those toys as the explorer.  I don't know anyone who has kept the ixl- they have all returned it because they didn't like it for different reasons and have been happy with theri exploreres.  But as with anything, these are just what I have come across and loved and what I like someone else may not. I can say honestly that they are VERY durable! They get dropped, dragged, we bring them everywhere and aside from that one swim accident never had a problem (and it has gotten wet from a dropped glass on it and totally fine).",NA,"[3, 3]",1
"Fisher Price ixl VS Leapster Explorer Which one is the better choice? As I've read reviews for both, I still cant quite decide. They both seem to both have about same number of good and bad reviews. So Im still at a toss up between the two.",descriptive,"CANCENURGY, thank you for your opinions. I'm glad to see I'm not the only one debating this.Update: I decided to go with the iXL.There aren't that many games for it, but I figured the ones they had were enough for her, since they all have the same concepts.Each CD comes with three games, an e-book, coloring pages for that character, and words to learn in the writing mode. You load the game directly onto the iXL, so there's no cartridges to lose. You can also load up music so it acts like an i-pod, and photographs from the family for him to look at or doodle on. You can install an SD card to expand the memory also. Explorer does the e-books, but you download it directly from their site, and you have to pay extra for them. It seemed very expensive to get all of the same things out of the Explorer as out of the iXL.One of the other things I didn't like about the Explorer were the complaints people had about the built-in advertising. It seems the kids had to sit and wait for the ""commercial"" to play through before they could play their game.I did like some of the aspects of the explorer: they let you hook the unit up to the computer to see what concepts your kid understands, and they had many more games than fisher price, but I felt like those were just as good with the cheaper Leapster 2. Here's a chart from Leap Frog to compare Explorer to the other hand-helds, but of course it's a little biased: leapfrog.com/explorer/compare.Good Luck!",NA,"[4, 5]",0

A brushless motor has the coils permanently mounted on the outer case and the North/South magnets are mounted on the drive shaft, thus no need for brushes since the coils are stationary.

You just have to remember to take it easy with them, if you need a lightsaber for hard hitting duels I would recommend the $10 or $15 dollar ones at wal-mart(the ones that are just plastic with no electronics, they last the longest for hard hitting duels). But these are great for display, costumes, very light duelling or terrorizing your pets.",NA,"[3, 3]",1

does it keep birds away,yesno,"No, it doesn't seem to. Ravens and hummingbirds still come. I have them in a flower bed close to the street",N,"[2, 2]",1
does it keep birds away,yesno,"Not as much as keeping the squirrels away. When the wind stays above 10mph and spinning fast , yes as for as sparrows and finches.   But for larger birds ,blue j's and mocking birds they need the wind around 15mph.   Or you can adjust the angle at lower wind speeds to catch the wind better.  I have pipe stake's four feet above the ground and the pinwheels are attached with two plastic tie wraps tight at the top , about every three feet.     Pipe is painted green , helps hide them.     You will still be able to move the pinwheels around to get better wind.   This may be a lot to do  but I am in my garden every day so for me its not a problem.  I find over the years I have less damage with my tomato's using them.   Some years,  very hot times,  the birds in fifty feet of tomato's can ruin twenty five or more pounds and that hurts.  In a few years the mylar may need some adjust or repair but these are the best I founded.   Bottom line they work for me.  The birds can visit  my flower beds BUT stay out and off my tomatoes !",NA,"[2, 2]",1

Does Big Box 3 have watermarks/icons on expansion tiles? Do the copies of Big Box 3 being sold by Amazon (or merchants) have the various expansion tiles marked with watermarks/icons that distinguish which expansion a tile belongs to?  Thanks,descriptive,"To elaborate on Wesley Wong's post, the small icons are on the front of the tiles, not on the gray backside.  The backsides are also not different shades of gray (at least as far as I can tell), and so putting the tiles in a small bag to draw from during play isn't necessary.  This also makes it very easy to separate out the expansion tiles after the game is over, because the icons are all 'face-up' on the table.  In my opinion, it is a very intuitive and well-planned system.",NA,"[3, 3]",1

I've no experience with airbrushes. Looking for one to use w/ my son to build plastic models.Is this a good choice for that purpose?,descriptive,"Depends on his purpose.  There are two main companies for airbrushes, Paasche and Iwata.  The basic differences between the Paasche H (single action) and for example, the Iwata Eclipse (dual action) are how the airbrushes function. The benefits of the H are that it is easy to clean (which is really good for a person who hasn't used one before) and it can handle thicker paint with the attachments in this set. This model also allows for use with the mixing cup (which sits off to the side of the top of the brush) and the higher capacity glass jars that sit below. This is an external mix airbrush which means that the paint isn't actually inside of the airbrush, it comes out at the tip and is sprayed on by the air below. I do special effects prosthetics and this is the airbrush of choice for most of that work (until you need detail and precision).  The Eclipse from Iwata is an internal mix airbrush so it's harder to use and a bit pickier about the paint you can put in it (it needs to be the proper consistency).  Also, it uses the gravity feed (small cup) on top and not a higher capacity jar.  If you are painting small amounts or changing colors frequently it won't matter.  However, the Eclipse is better at detail (with a Micron by Iwata being the Cadillac of airbrushes) having more precision and allows for more control over the spray due to having a different trigger.  This airbrush is used by a lot of fine art illustrators.  With both you will need an air compressor and will want to make sure that you have it properly hooked up so that you can maintain proper air pressure.  The air compressors can be expensive.  I got a good one from Paasche that I ordered on Amazon.  I see the other comments talk about the H coming unhooked, I've never had this issue and for the H when I researched the professionals all recommended this brush.  I used the Eclipse recently at a class for painting Silicone realistically (so it looks like skin) and it was also a very nice brush and I bought it when I was done with the class.  For any airbrush, proper cleaning is the most important thing... no matter how good the airbrush (and both these companies are leaders in the industry) if you don't clean it right away (with the proper solvents/water depending on the paint you are using) you won't be able to use it very long.  Airbrushes are notorious for clogging and are a little temperamental. The H is pretty easy to clean compared to the dual action brushes.",NA,"[2, 2]",1

Are the mosnters asymetrical (i.e. do they have different traits)?,yesno,"In the basic game they are more of just ""tokens"" so you can see who is in Tokyo and who is out.  No special features...they are all the same.  The special features come from the cards you buy-- extra dice, extra points, on-going damage attacks, etc....  Basically: Everyone starts out the same, and then you build your own abilities based on the cards available (maybe someone else buys it before you can!) and the ""money/energy"" you have aquired.In the expansion, though (I don't have it, but have looked into it because the base game is AMAZING and I want more!), it looks as though the monsters will start with different abilities.",NA,"[2, 2]",1

Would it be very hard to put some small lights into this model to show though the windows?,descriptive,"I have this model and intend on doing just that. It would be far too difficult to light each window, so you will have to somehow diffuse the light in sections and use either fiber optics and or LEDs - both of which I will be using. You may need to Dremel out the window openings and run some fiber-optics throughout the hull to reach some of the more difficult areas to light, like the boat deck and Promenade. As far as the light showing though the windows, I intend to use wax paper as a backing - you can't see through it but it will light up nicely. This is about the smallest model you can conceivably light up. You will have to do a lot of pre-planning for the lighting, but I think it will be a fun and challenging project with an excellent payoff if you have the patience to see it through.",NA,"[2, 2]",1

What are the diffrences to the next model the Hausler 450 SE V2 RTF for $178.00.  Is it worth to spent the extra money?,descriptive,"The differences are the individual parts of the heli.  If I remember correctly, the main difference is in the main rotor assembly.  The standard has a mostly plastic main rotor assembly and the SE V2 has a mostly metal main rotor assembly.  If you are a beginner RC heli pilot or if you are buying this for someone who is, the differences will probably be transparent.  If you have experience with non-hobby grade helis, these fly a lot different.  Once thing is for sure, you will need spare parts.  I suggest purchasing a simulator (Pheonix or RealFlight heli) that uses an actual RC transmitter.  These simulators are a little expensive (around $200) but well worth it in the long run.  You will be able to learn to fly with out the heartache of crashing your actual heli.  One more thing, RTF (ready to fly) doesn't mean just take it out of the box and go.  You really need to learn about your heli and do some research about pre-flight checks and first time flight preparation procedures.  While RC helis of this size and type are bought at toy stores and in toy departments, these are serious pieces of electronics and spinning blades that can hurt you or others if you don't take precautions.  There are a lot of good websites and forums out there to help you learn.  Its well worth the time and effort.  It took me some time and I am definitely still learning, but I love to fly...and crash and fix and do it all again.",NA,"[2, 2]",1

Does this doll comes with any fragrance? Are her vinyl soft?,descriptive,"The vinyl was stiff w/ a smooth matte finish.It is absolutely the sweetest face I have ever seen in a baby doll.It is such a shame that the doll has a STRONG chemical odor....reminescent....in my opinion, to bug repellent. Without unwrapping, I took it out of the box to try to air out and see if that helped, but I started having a coughing reaction to it. NO WAY would I give this to a child or anyone for that matter. My grown up daughter did not have this problem when I showed her, altho, she could smell the chemical. Altho you did not ask, the legs contained those small beebee size balls, as in a beanbag chair, and I thought those were outlawed in ""stuff"" for small children and pets. I informed the company we bought it from thru Amazon. I had to pay return shipping, about $12 even tho it was purchased w/ prime A. And the problem was not our fault.

I have a question about Disney Princess Collection 7-Doll Gift Set. Are the princesses dresses cloth or plastic.,descriptive,"They are squishy rubber. The neck of each dress has a cut in the back to allow it to stretch enough to get the princess in and out of the dress. They are too soft for the princess to be able to stand up.NOTE: In my experience, it is very hard and very irritating to dress and undress these dolls due to the rubbery dresses. My 2 year-old can't do it, and it takes me a lot of effort to do, leaving us both frustrated. I recommend the princesses with clip-on ""Magi-Clip"" dresses. Fast, easy, and my daughter can do herself. They are the same size as these, and the dresses are hard plastic. You pinch the bottom and the top of the dress opens up so you can slide the princess in. Then she can stand up in it. All dresses are ""one size fits all"" and can be interchanged among all of the dolls. Such a wonderful concept and lots of fun for the kids!",NA,"[2, 2]",1
Are the dresses removable and if so will the dolls fit in the Magiclip dresses?,descriptive,The dresses are removable and it does fit in the Magiclip dresses.

"Considering ordering this for my 3,4, and 9 year old children.  They love using blankets over the couch to make forts to play in.  My youngest always knocks it down though.  Is this sturdy? Will it stay up with a toddler in it? It almost looks to complex for them.  Can you just build a simple fort also?  Does it end up being an annoying mess all over the floor?  Appreciate any input and love seeing so many rave reviews, just asking some personal questions that I had. Thanks!",descriptive,"Our two kids (ages 5 and 7 at the time we bought the set) used to build couch forts all the time, but for the past year they've strongly preferred to build with this set instead.  And make no mistake-- it still gets heavy use by both kids over a year later.  The kids understood the kit pretty intuitively and started building structures right away, so I don't think it would be too complex (at least for your 4 and 9 year olds).  And yes, you can build a simple fort with it.  After helping them build their first structure, they seem to be able to manage building projects by themselves.  They rarely bother clipping fabric to the framework, though.  They're fine with using just the framework, as clipping or unclipping the fabric often *does* require my help and without some effort can look messy.IF the rods are pressed fully into the connectors, the structures hold together impressively well, even with kids crashing into them.  If the rods aren't pressed all the way in, they'll sometimes pull apart if kids bump or lean on them.  Training our kids to fully push the rods into the connectors (a bit of a twist helps) took a bit of work.  Our older child grasped how to do this after we walked him through it a few times.  Our younger child has been more hit-or-miss, so he'll sometimes ask for help ""firming up"" the structure.We keep all of the pieces in the box they shipped in and require the kids to break down their structures and put the pieces back in the box when they're done, so there typically isn't much mess beyond the structure itself.  If your kids dump out all the pieces or aren't good about putting unused pieces away, that could be quite a mess, though.  Because they use the set so much, we're leaning towards getting bins for the various connector types to make them easier to find.",NA,"[4, 7]",0

I'd say watch for fabric sales and have at it.",NA,"[3, 3]",1
does it come with covers?,yesno,"NO fabric. But their website says they will sell it soon and I've signed up to be alerted when. Probably would be an overkill as one may use a disposable colored table cover any shape or cut yourself from Party City (from 99 cents to a few dollars depending how fancy you want the pattern), they are very light, I would not use fabric clips and just use a small scotch tape piece for them. Fabric clips for actual bed sheets. We already have  Fortamajig and it goes well to attach to anything with no clips as they have velcro closures, makes a great combo. In defence of the inventor much criticised in many recent reviews, I just put together a shopping basket for Home Depot pvc pipes that would provide for a kit similar in opportunities to the kits offered by this product. I used a roll of flexible pvc that can be cut to make for  curved pieces and a straight solid pvc for the main sticks. Home depot pvc pipes have all kinds of elbows and tees to go with them but not a 6-way connector. I thought up a way to remedy that and to adjust for any angle. In the basket I put the cheapest 1/2 inch pvc (they come in white, red, blue, yellow, green, white being the cheapest). I admit I splurged on connectors. Used 10 feet pipes assuming they will cut in the store for free. The basket was over $70 (the reviewers who claim under $25 only aim for a basic fort, for which one better buy a ready-fort with cover for $30-60 for kids). The basket would allow to build about half of the structures listed. If you want thicker pipes, Home depot has them with the correct connectors, 1"" or 2"", 4"" or 6"", even fractional diameters, but these are proportionally more expensive (I've used pvc connectors to play construction with my kid for a long time, so why not add the corresponding pipes and make it big). It can be easily adapted to build the structures Fort magic advertises. The advantage is, it may grow later - Home depot is nearby. The disadvantage is, no 6-way connectors. With $60 discount if you open an amazon card, Fort Magic  will be around $140 - the same as a double of my Home depot basket. Thus the price seem to be ok for the product offered. You may still go for the pvc pipes if you find an outlet that sells them cheaper online, but then get a pvc cutter to cut to size. I probably will go with the product advertised here as it is ready to use right from the box, not sure yet, if my local store cuts the pipes for free might go with them. Happy building with kids, everyone! Postscriptum: their main competition seems to be not a hord of cheaper forts that offer little number of parts and had earn many ""too flimsy"" complaints, but the toydle forts (google it and get to their website), a very pricey kit that DOES come with inventive fabrics and online videos etc. They are similarly priced but a bit more expensive (way more with the fabric kit). They do have the coolest wooden (!) connectors, which could probably double as building blocks (2.5"" size), very stable from the look of it, they are 6-way. Toydle uses pvc pipes, pre-cut 29"" length, almost 1"" diameter - note, upgrading my shopping basket in Home Depot from 1/2 inch to 1 inch would almost double the price. So now 3 options to pick from: my own pvc set from Home Depot, this one and the toydle kit. I would prefer toydle would use the standard 1"" pvc so it could be combined with Home depot-bought parts, but the website says it is a hair shy of 1"". Still undecided.",NA,"[3, 3]",1

This looks like a cool product but the price tag is about 3x's higher than I expected. Can anyone share a testimony of why this was worth $200?,descriptive,"For Melanie: 40-50 dollars to manufacture Fort Magic, subtracted from $199, is the gross profit margin. Gross profit is before operating expenses are deducted (for example, Amazon alone takes approximately 25% of each sale, then you have to subtract all other operating expenses, marketing costs, etc.) Net profit is after operating expenses are deducted. The net profit on the Fort Magic kit is zero to date. This means Fort Magic has not made any profit on the kit yet. This is due to the cost of running and growing the company. Unfortunately, Shark Tank was highly edited and did not tell the complete story. In reality the owner was in front of the Sharks for 1.5 hours and they heard all of the financial information (unlike the audience). A ""x4"" is a minimum recommend margin for ALL healthy businesses. Every business that markets a product aims for a x4 from its manufacturing cost as a minimum to keep its doors open and grow. Fort Magic is priced as low as it can be without going out of business. Which is why it is still $199, even after the Shark Tank confusion. It is the best price the company can offer. Fort Magic values our customers immensely and we always provide the best possible price for our kit, as well as the best possible customer service. For TF:  The reviews of Fort Magic are 100% real.  You only need to read them to see they are all clearly written by different people.  They repeatedly remark on similar qualities because our product quality and outstanding customer service is consistent and top notch.  As is the high level of value and enjoyment each of these families have received from owning Fort Magic.  If you prefer, read only the ""verified Amazon purchase"" reviews.  They also remark the same way and there are numerous reviews from verified customer purchases.  The other customers who have left reviews have purchased from our Fort Magic store directly (before our online store was closed 5/2014 to sell exclusively on Amazon).  There are even 28 additional 5 star reviews that are ALL ""verified Amazon purchase"" reviews on our seller feedback section (as ONLY verified Amazon customers may review there), all with the same type of remarks as well.  Further, if you visit our website or Facebook page you will see the numerous photos of dozens of families and children enjoying Fort Magic, and you will see again they are all different families.  Fort Magic has also won four of the toy industry's top educational toy awards.  Each of these toy award agencies have independently reviewed the Fort Magic kit and also remark on the identical beneficial and enjoyable qualities our customers rave about.  It is preposterous to say the reviews have been faked.  It is an impossible action no rational person would even be interested in attempting.  Whereas, building the highest quality product, with the highest quality customer service, that customers appreciate and love enough to want to tell everyone about it, is logical and commendable.  No amount of negative comments from non-customers will detour our commitment to providing the best to our real customers.

Once tied it held beautifully and worked great. Bean bags land in little nets. Smaller bags that come with it work better bc they are lighter.

There are features with counting and other educational features that are good for preschoolers and maybe early kindergarteners.

Does it work with two player battle system that comes with 2 phoenix LTX taggers?,descriptive,"Yes it does. If you are debating which guns to get though here are a few things to keep in mind.These Guns offer more variety on shooting and info on gameplay (such as hits and clips) however this is only when an Ipod is connected via the downloadable app. This also allows for single player mode. The Ipod also helps a lot in outdoor play as it makes it easier to hit at larger distances, this makes it completely unfair against an LTX tagger. Indoor play is fairly balanced with or without ipod connection (there are some unlockables which can make gameplay unfair). Without the Ipod connection you have no idea as to your health or ammo supply. You also have no ability to change weapon types. The housing for the Ipod is also annoying with no Ipod attached, it can be removed but tools are required.In my situation I have a bunch of these guns which I let kids run around with in our church building. I keep the Ipod housings hidden, since most kids do not have an Ipod connection. I wish I had the LTX taggers instead since they have more to offer without the ipod connection.",NA,"[2, 2]",1

If you want to go faster, then you will have to glue them on. You can use 3M double sided tape and it will hold. Do not use the clear stuff. To remove, you pull them off then use denatured alcohol and a hair dryer to remove the tape. Since the alcohol will remove the wax from the car, you will need to protect the paint (or clear coat) by applying a good hard wax.I also would not use these on cars for more than one day.

"I can't seem to trim the left/right drift.

The white arms directly mounted to your servos. The one on the left (looking from the back) controls right and left movement. If this is not level it could easily cause the problem and can be remedied by loosing the mounting screw and readjusting the arm to a more level position. If that is not the case try removing the left servo linkage (looking at the helicopter from the back.) Then screw the metal linkage further into the plastic buckle. Do this in small increments until you begin to see more level flight. Hope this helps and good luck.,NA,"[3, 3]",1

That being said, my boy likes the toy and even at his age (now 6) cannot put it into his mouth, much less try to swallow it.  There are no little parts and he cannot remove the battery.

You can buy a BNF helicopter for 20.00$ w/o the extra transmitter( just the helicopter) which means bind and fly using the same transmitter from the original purchased heli w/ transmitter!,NA,"[2, 2]",1
What is the radio range on the helicopter?,descriptive,As far as the on the radio. It boosts a range of 40 to 80 meters.  That would be roughly 120 to 240 feet. I have got it up to 90 feet with no problems but at that distance the heli gets very same and hard to see. This copter is not ment to be flown at 200 or more feet. Most people that are not into RC hobbies always want to know how high a heli or airplane will fly without even wondering if they will be able to see it at a height of 1000 feet. I think that the range of 40 to 80 meters is very good for this transmitter. I personally like to fly mine no further than 60 feet away. Hope this helps.,NA,"[2, 2]",1

How does this compare to Forbidden Island? If I own the other should I buy this one as well?,descriptive,"Forbidden Desert goes up to 5 players instead of 4, and is slightly more involved than Forbidden Island though it is not really more complex. One major difference is that in Forbidden Island you know where the artifacts are that you are trying to get. The main challenge is getting the cards (set collection) required to actually get those artifacts, all while the island is sinking. In Forbidden Desert the challenge is in finding the clues that tell you where the parts to the flying machine are, all while the tiles of the game board are moving around and getting covered by sand. Personally, I prefer Forbidden Desert because of this exploration aspect. Your 6yo (I read your review of Forbidden Island) will probably also enjoy putting together the pieces of the flying machine. The players also each pick a different character to play with unique abilities. This adds to the strategy a bit as it will make different players better at different things. For instance the Water Carrier will spend a lot of their time distributing water to the other players.As for whether you should buy FD if you already have FI; that would depend on 1) how much you enjoy playing FI and 2) if FI is starting to feel so so and losing its challenge. FD is similar enough that you will pick it up very quickly but different enough that it will provide new challenge and variety. If you find your family sitting in front of the TV more and playing FI less, don't delay in getting FD. For me, at a price point of less than $20 I would easily get it even if I had the other. I have games that cost 3x the price that I haven't played half as many times as FD. For the cost of about 3 movie tickets, it's one of the best deals in gaming.And as an aside, if you are interested in something with more depth and strategy, take a look at Pandemic by the same designer. It has similarities to both FD and FI.",NA,"[11, 11]",1
How does this compare to Forbidden Island? If I own the other should I buy this one as well?,descriptive,"Forbidden Island is easier.  It's easier to learn how to play because the rules are a little simpler, and it's easier to win.  There are enough gameplay differences between the games that it's fun to play both, and I own both.   Here's an example... in Forbidden Island you have a ""Waters Rise"" card which advances the number of cards drawn each turn.  In Forbidden Desert you have a ""Storm Picks Up"" card that does the same... but you also have a ""Sun Beats Down"" card that makes all exposed players drink one of their waters.  Each player must track their own water supply and ensure that they don't run out of water.  I love them both, and I would recommend starting with Forbidden Island and move to Forbidden Desert when you want a bigger challenge.",NA,"[4, 4]",1
How does this compare to Forbidden Island? If I own the other should I buy this one as well?,descriptive,"We own both.  We play Forbidden Island with kids and people who are beginners at strategy games.  We play Forbidden Desert when it's just the two of us or when we are playing with our gamer friends.  Forbidden Desert takes a similar concept to Forbidden Island and increases the difficulty by three.  There are more ways to lose than there are to win.  If you are looking for a more difficult strategy game, then yes, you should buy this one.",NA,"[4, 4]",1
How does this compare to Forbidden Island? If I own the other should I buy this one as well?,descriptive,"If you enjoyed FI then you will be very happy with FD. They both play differently.

does anyone know which dimension or brand card sleeves i should get to protect the 24 tile cards (the think square tiles)?,descriptive,"The tiles measure approximately 63x63mm square, but they are about 2mm thick so it will probably require at least a 66x66mm square sleeve. Swan Panasia makes sleeves in 65x65mm, 67x67mm and 70x70mm square dimensions. Amazon does not seem to have any of these specific sizes, but they can be ordered directly from swanpanasiasleeves.com. I would recommend at least the 67x67mm but if you don't mind having the extra sleeve around the edge, the 70x70mm is almost certain to work. I have no direct experience with this application, but I have sleeves from them for standard thickness cards and they work well. Mayday also makes a 70x70mm sleeve that Amazon has here Small Square Card Sleeves Any of these options would also work if you wanted to sleeve the sand tiles. One other thing to consider is that once sleeved, the tiles will no longer fit in the plastic divider included in the game box.",NA,"[2, 2]",1

Can you excavate another tile while not on it (ie one space away) as they did in tabletop?,descriptive,Yes. This game works the same way as the Forbidden Island.

Can equipment cards be used by a player when it's not that person's turn?,descriptive,It appears that only the Time Throttle card must be played during the turn of the person holding it.  It is the only equipment card that mentions this limitation.  All other equipment cards can be used freely at any time.  I believe this is consistent with what is stated in the rule booklet.

Why does this not ship to Australia?,descriptive,"The manufacturer (Wizards of the Coast) has a requirement in place that shops cannot ship outside their region.  So US based shops cannot ship outside the US & its territories.  To obtain this in Australia, you will need to go to a local shop or find a seller on Amazon who is based in Australia.

"Please, I need to give Magic cards to an *experienced* player. Is this a good choice? Is there something better for similar price?",descriptive,"This should be a nice gift for most MTG players.

I've read that the 2014 version of this train is worth waiting for ... can you tell me what improvements / changes have been made for the 2014?,descriptive,"The 2014 Version has full sounds, synchronized smoke output to the chuffing, and full remote control including announcements.  It's a major upgrade.",NA,"[6, 7]",0
What's the difference between this train and the other train listed for $1 more? They are both polar express o-Gauge.,descriptive,"The newer version does not have the add-on piping (wire) that runs down both mid-sides of the locomotive boiler.  The new version appears to have that detail molded or cast in to the diecast shell.  Although, IMO the older ""wire"" version ""looks"" better, the wire stanchions that held the wire away from the loco's shell often broke.  So the newer molded in version is probably a better and more practical design especially if handled by children. :-)Although the newer version can operate simultaneously with the other newly released Lionel LIONCHIEF remote controlled locomotives, I'm unsure if it can simultaneously run with other conventionally/transformer controlled (Fwd/Neutral/Rev) locomotives.  As noted by others, this new version INCLUDES sounds, engine chuff, steam whistle (much better than the old air whistle) and conductor dialogue clips taken from the Polar Exp movie (""All aboooaaard! This is the Polar Express"" and ""Tickets, tickets please"").  This is a great feature and value because on the older/original non-remote version required you to buy a separate tender and conductor announcement car that cost an additional $160 combined.A couple of Youtube videos give you a good idea of the features:http://youtu.be/iwqn2Dfy6ZQhttp://youtu.be/ygwkiGZ1O20",NA,"[3, 3]",1

The second set is 6-30218 which is also electric but is operated with a transformer and and a handheld remote control device.

Wasn't happy about it either!",NA,"[2, 2]",1
what is the difference between O-gauge and G-gauge?,descriptive,"The O-Gauge Trains are mostly metal and the G-Gauge are all plastic...Unlike the O-Gauge polar express train set, the G-Gauge set is made up of plastic as it would then be lighter for younger kids to play safely. The locomotive body as well as tracks is completely plastic. Another major difference between the two is the fact that the G- Gauge Lionel Polar Express Train Set is run on a battery, not electricity. That's the reason this model is a lot cheaper as well.",NA,"[8, 10]",0
what is the difference between O-gauge and G-gauge?,descriptive,"O vs G is the size of the tracks which translate into the size of your train + accessories.  The Christmas trains sets you will typically find in toy stores are G.  They are maybe twice as big as O gauge.  Because of the larger size, the G gauge in retail stores are typically plastic - lighter, cheaper and run on batteries.  I have yet to see an O in your normal retail store.  O gauge is 1:48 scale (vs 1:22-29 of G).  Myself, am shopping for an O gauge that does not run on batteries.  Like this one.",NA,"[3, 4]",0

Is this mattress comfortable enough to be slept in every day?,descriptive,"Sorry to say, but no.The filling (which I assume is compressed chunks of cotton?) is very clumpy and nearly impossible to evenly flatten to create a balanced comfort. The filling is always shifting around, meaning sometimes Totoro's head will be very padded while his feet section will be flat and empty. Other times all the filling will clump up in the middle, leaving you with a huge mound under your back. This bed is NOTHING like a futon! It's more like a giant pillow with shifting filling. I would never recommend extended sleeping on this.If the filling was more solid and nicely distributed inside the shell, it would be much more practicable for long-term sleeping.(written by a 26yr old male who has owned this ""bed"" for nearly 1 year)",NA,"[3, 3]",1

I am a Nanny, girls in my care received this product for their 3rd birthday.  They absolutely love the Sands Alive, but I have concerns for product ingredients, as the ingredients are not listed on the box which we do still have, all that is stated is ""Note-Sands Alive! is made from all natural, organic materials and can vary slightly in color and texture.""  This product is U.S. Patent but Made in South Korea with a Foreign patents pending as stated on the box as well.  So let's say one of the children in my care develops an allergy or somehow it is ingested maybe not intentionally but because the product is on their hands or gets into their eyes and child has to be taken to the hospital, what would we tell poison control or the emergency room and I have researched on line, there are no answers to be found about the chemical compounds or ingredients.

We don't do castles though...ours is a mini construction site (bulldozer, excavator, etc) and we build roads & cliffs, destroy them, repeat. It's fun stuff.

are they going to lose there glow eventually?,yesno,"Most ""glow-in-the-dark"" products are made with Zinc Sulfide (short glow time) or Strontium Aluminate (longer glow time).  Both of these compounds are phosphors that give off light after being charged.  I would guess the ""glow"" in these bands is due to Zinc Sulfide since the glow time is around 5-10 min a ""charge"".  To the best of my knowledge either one can be recharged indefinitely without suffering any loss of performance.  The more intense the light used for charging, the brighter the initial glow.  Hope this helps answer your question.",NA,"[2, 2]",1
"How long will the dji phantom fly with standard battery, and is extended flight possible with larger batt ?",descriptive,"You will get anywhere from 10 to 12 minutes on this battery if your Phantom is left stock and your camera is mounted on the Phantom housing. Wind conditions and the way you fly are also contributing factors to battery life. The battery compartment will restrict you from getting anything much bigger. Many people have made modifications to the Phantom to use bigger batteries and even multiple batteries but remember that the more weight you add to the copter, the more the engines have to work. So often times these modifications will demand more power. Hope this helps...",NA,"[2, 2]",1

does the furby boom need an ipod touch or iphone?,descriptive,"No it's not required.There's lots of fun to be had with the Furby without the phone.I do think you miss out on some things without the phone/tablet however. 1 of the biggest downsides to not having a device with the app that comes to mind, is you wont be able to name your Furby. You name the Furby through the app, and then it knows it's own name and will say his own name (for example I named my Furby Day-Dah (which is furbish for Big Fluff lol) and sometimes he'll say things like ""Day-Dah like!"" or ""Day-Dah happy!"").Also if you put 2 or more Furby booms together, they'll tell each other their names and then they'll remember each other's names in the future. Just another little thing you'd miss out on without being able to name your furby through the app.You miss out on some other neat features too such as the translator in the app (you hold your device up to your furby, and as the furby speaks, the app will in real time translate what he's saying! It's pretty neat!). And there's several other fun activities to do with your Furby with the app you miss out on (leveling your Furby up by feeding him different foods, giving him showers, taking him to the bathroom, and giving him medicine if he becomes sick).And finally you miss out on these little 'mini' furbies they call Furblings in the app. Your furby will lay eggs with your phone/tablet in the app and you can hatch the egg and care for the furbling by playing mini games (soccer and a dance game for example) and feeding it. It's a lot like a tamagotchi.But...the furby is still tons of fun without the app! I do enjoy using my app with my Furbs, but I find I play with him a lot without the app as well.",NA,"[6, 6]",1
does the furby boom need an ipod touch or iphone?,descriptive,It doesn't NEED it. As in it will work as a stand alone toy BUT a lot of it features are centered around the apps.

Is This Quad recommended for first time users?,descriptive,"I was a first time user and found that flight and especially landing took some getting used to. Several have recommended getting a ""toy"" quad to practice and after a few crashes I often wish that I had. However, watch the training videos until you're comfortable with the pre-flight process, especially the sat alignment. Practice flight in an open field and follow the included Pilot Training exercises. Give yourself a good 8 hours of flight time before you get too comfortable. Launching and flight are relatively easy as long as the bird is facing away from you. It gets progressively tricky as the orientation changes. Get comfortable with turning off the controller to let it return home on its own. That will give you the confidence to go hands-off and trust that it will return.If your purpose is photography, be aware that the still images are pretty sweet but the video is a bit rough since it only has a single axis gimbal. For good video you should consider a quad with a dual axis gimbal and maybe a GoPro.",NA,"[3, 3]",1

"Having a problem stabilizing Nano. Props are in correct locations, did the stabilizing routine, throttle to right & right joystick back and forth.",yesno,"Try this.  Start with a fresh battery charge. Turn on the transmitter and then the Nano. Start clicking the trim button for left/right trim button in one direction and listen for a beep on the transmitter.  If you don't get the beep after 10 or so clicks, go the opposite direction until you hear a beep. If you click it a few more times, you will notice that the beep is louder at one point.  This what you're aiming for.  Do the same for the forward/reverse-- trim also.  This centers the controls on the transmitter.  Now recalibrate the accellerometers by placing the Nano on a solid, LEVEL surface, pulling and holding the throttle control stick down to the right corner, and toggling the other control stick from side to side fairly fast until you see the blue LED's on the Nano blink, indicating success.Now do a test flight. Move the throttle very slowly up and observe that all the propellers start turning at the same time and at the same speed.  If they are not, check to make sure that they are not pressed onto the motor shaft too far, and binding on the motor. If one of the propellers is slow to start, you probably have a motor starting to fail.  Make sure none of the propellers is bent or damaged. If they all spin up the same, take off and try to hoover a foot off the ground or so.  Don't take off slow.  The backdraft from the ground will affect the stability.  Give it enough throttle to quickly get a little altitude. Note which way the Nano tends to drift, land it, and click the trim in the opposite direction for what ever way the Nano is drifting.  Take off again and see if it helped, and if it needs more trim.  If it needs more, give it another click or two. Do this for booth trim buttons.  Once you get it pretty close to where it will pretty much hoover in one spot, you can do some fine tuning while it is in flight.  It is very important to get it 'trimmed' as close as possible.  It makes a night and day difference with making the Nano easier to control.  A few pointers--Re calibrate the accellerometors before each flight.  Go easy on the controls. Don't over-react.  If you sense a crash coming, imediately bring the throttle control to OFF! If Nano tends to get a little 'touchy' during flight, land it on a level surface for at least three seconds.  This stabilizes the accellerometers.  Study how the motors are installed and soldered. My experience is that sooner or later, usually sooner, a motor will fail and need to be replaced. If you feel confident that you or someone you know is capable of changing a motor, I would try to order an extra set or two.  They've been extreemly hard to come by.  On back order all over the place forever.  But I was able to order some from RPP HOBBY (http://www.rpphobby.com/product_p/este4617.htm) yesterday.  I'd scarf up a few sets if I were you.GOOD LUCK!!

how long does it run on one charge,descriptive,"Dan is pretty much correct in the time it takes to charge with the stock USB charger. But for the RUN time, it depends on how aggressively/conservatively it's flown. I tend to get between 5 and 8 minutes of flight time before the LEDs blink to warn of low battery voltage and the impending LVC. If you upgrade the transmitter to a spare X4 (version 2) transmitter (see my answer to the 2.4GHz interference and novice flying question), you'll have the ability to switch the LEDs off (and on again) to extend flight time even more (at the expense of being able to maintain orientation in all but the brightest of flight environments, since this vehicle is so small).",NA,"[3, 3]",1

You can even play Heart of Cormyr against someone else with the same set.  Or you can combine all five of the base sets into a single set.,NA,"[2, 2]",1

Can you play a Jedi or other Force wielder in this game?,descriptive,"In the book they have force sensitive, but no Jedi. The book is part 1 of 3. Book 3 is supposed to have Jedi. Edge of the empire has focus on the seedy side of Star Wars. Such as criminals, bounty hunters etc.",NA,"[2, 2]",1
Can you play a Jedi or other Force wielder in this game?,descriptive,"You can play a ""Force Exile"" - someone who has natural talent, but no formal training in the Force. The book only presents 3 powers, and the Force Adept is an additional specialization that is pretty expensive to invest in experience-wise. It is tough to play a force user in the game - and fittingly so (keep in mind that this game is set at the height of the Empire's power, and there are few force-users in the galaxy.)All said, it is pretty easy to adapt and houserule in additional force powers and specializations, especially if you have any familiarity with the Saga Edition. While these are two different rule systems, the career specializations work similarly.",NA,"[4, 5]",0
Can you play a Jedi or other Force wielder in this game?,descriptive,"There are Jedi and then there are JEDI. Yes, you can choose the Force Sensitive Exile specialization. No, this is not the Jedi of that you are most likely familiar with from the Episodes 1 - 3. With regards to the scope of The Edge of the Empire, the Force is played down and not a primary focus...hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a blaster.",NA,"[4, 5]",0
Can you play a Jedi or other Force wielder in this game?,descriptive,"Put simplest, no; there are no Jedi *yet*.  This game is focusing more on the common side of the universe - less ""take on the Sith and/or stop the Empire"" and more ""you're a band of misfits in the Star Wars galaxy, trying to live a life of adventure without getting beaten up, kidnapped or stopped by the Empire, Bounty Hunters or other such scum and villany""There is, however, a ""Force Sensitive Exile"" which is the first step to intorducing Jedi to the system.  Currently, there are only three force abilities available (plus a page worth of skills to help boost your character) and none are as large-scale as you typically think of when you think of the Force or Jedi - the most directly inflouential ability is force move, which is to gently move small objects around, but can (with training) reach an ability to throw objects larger than Rancore across a field for damage... but it takes A LOT of experience points (95 to be precise - in a system where you deal with 5-15xp at a time).The two following Core Rule Books (Age of Rebellion - recently released and the third, yet-to-be-announced book) will expand on the Force some more, eventually working Jedi and Force users into it.  As mentioned in another answer; Fantasy Flight Games is attempting to make these books follow loosely around the time/era of the original trilogy (A New Hope; Empire Strikes Back: Return of the Jedi) and the themes they followed (aNH - introduction to the Force; ESB - development of the Force; RotJ - Force control and active use).",NA,"[2, 3]",0
How does the Edge of the Empire book compare to Rodney Thompson's saga edition books and could EotE be used along with Rodney Thompson's books?,descriptive,"Edge of the Empire is very different mechanically from Saga.  Saga is typical D20 system and offers a wide range of setting options.  Edge has a narrow story focus (a time when Jedi are nearly extinct) and the different mechanics are integral to the game.  (it uses custom dice, for example)  I've played and enjoyed both - but even trying to use much of the Saga material as 'inspiration' for Edge would be difficult (due to lack of force users).  You might get some good ideas from a book like Scum and Villany, although you'd have to bridge the mechanical differences.",NA,"[5, 5]",1
How does the Edge of the Empire book compare to Rodney Thompson's saga edition books and could EotE be used along with Rodney Thompson's books?,descriptive,"There is a major difference between Edge of the Empire and Star Wars Saga edition. Edge of the Empire is set in a very narrow time frame around episode IV. Where in Saga Edition, you could run any timeline or storyline, Edge of the Empire is very limited in its design, requiring the player to run scoundrels. If you are planning on any adventure that focuses on elements from the movies such as Jedi, solders or massive space adventure with the force being a part of the story, Edge of the empire will be disappointing. If on the other hand you want a unique dice system and a narrow focus on the outer rim (Han Solo characters) This game will not disappoint you. The game rules may need house rules depending on your group. My group has made some major rule changes just to make the game run faster and smoother.",NA,"[4, 4]",1
How does the Edge of the Empire book compare to Rodney Thompson's saga edition books and could EotE be used along with Rodney Thompson's books?,descriptive,"As Darkraven alluded too, Edge of the Empire is for storytelling based out on the fringes of the Outer Rim, and the scoundrels and bounty hunters and fringers found there. The system developed by Fantasy Flight is being released in 3 parts in summer 2013, 2014, and 2015. The 3 sets of rules and stories are fully compatible and will ultimately describe the full variety of Star Wars characters and settings (including Jedi). So this is just one of 3 major portions of the galaxy.There are no numbers on the dice in this system--rather, levels of skill increase one's pool of skill dice; it would be a serious challenge to directly transfer a character verbatim from Rodney's system, but easy to loosely re-create scenarios, levels of difficulty, and player strengths based on the very strong role-play related elements in this system.It's a very clever mechanic! :)",NA,"[2, 2]",1
How does the Edge of the Empire book compare to Rodney Thompson's saga edition books and could EotE be used along with Rodney Thompson's books?,descriptive,I never played saga edition so I can't really answer that question. The game mechanics are very different from d20. So in that aspect they don't work together. However if you use eote from a knowledge aspect it can. It has a pretty detailed map of the Star Wars galaxy. As well as info of many planets. The antagonist section has a lot of NPCs that could be useful too.,NA,"[2, 4]",0
"I would like to know why this game has the same classification as the beginner box, ""toys & games / boardgame"" instead of ""books""?",descriptive,"The MAJOR problem is: with a toy/gameboard classification, the import taxes makes the cost to import the game too high (US$ 250). For me the amazon put the books in the same category that the Introdutory Box was. But the correct would be to classify as BOOK or in both category.For example, Shadowrun is the same as this product (an RPG book) and is classified as book (dont pay taxes to import)...",NA,"[3, 3]",1
"I would like to know why this game has the same classification as the beginner box, ""toys & games / boardgame"" instead of ""books""?",descriptive,"That is a good question...I also found this book in the ""Books"" section when I searched there.  Perhaps it has multiple categories it belongs to?  The beginner box can be confusing if you don't read exactly what you are buying.  So, just make sure you read the product description before ordering.  Ah see your other comments, and I see your point.  Often products that fall into multiple categories will be grouped into all applicable but not always.

Have you looked into the game maker (Fantasy Flight) to see if it is any different?",NA,"[2, 2]",1
"I would like to know why this game has the same classification as the beginner box, ""toys & games / boardgame"" instead of ""books""?",descriptive,"This is a mistake on the part of Amazon US. Amazon UK, CA and FR list the book properly, as just a book. They are classifying a roleplaying game MANUAL as a ""toy"" and taxing foreign buyers as such for no reason. This is NOT a board game, there are NO toys. The physical form of the product should determine it´s category -- this is a BOOK, not a ""game"" just because it´s a GAME MANUAL.

What is the difference between the jumbo box vs jumbo tube mats?,descriptive,"I purchased the jumbo box because it is easier to store,  however the mat was folded and I use the box to house the colored markers in sandwich bags, while I take the mat and roll it up around an old wrapping paper cardboard.   This keeps the mat from the creases of folding.

beach?,descriptive,"Well it does fine on muddy dirt and tall thick grass with a 2 year old (30 lbs) inside. Depends on how much cargo, (kids etc), and the stamina of the person pulling it. I would say yes with no more 60 lbs (2 kids).",NA,"[2, 2]",1
beach?,descriptive,depends. big fat tires help a lot in the sand but how much load are you going to have in the wagon? And just how strong is the person doing the pulling?

How long is it supposed to take before you see vegetables grow?

What kind of amazing tricks does it do?,descriptive,"Smaller children like to simply push the car.  This is epecially good for new walkers.  Once a child is more comfortable with their walking skills, the challenge is to get on and off the racer by themselves.  This takes motor skills and balance.  When they get the hang of getting on and off, the real FUN begins.  Toddlers can then learn to make the racer move with their feet and steer at the same time.

But from what I have seen, they are loving these, and they are able to maneuver them without any problems. The turning capability is just right for a young child, in my limited observation. One grandson was not yet able to walk, and he was able to stand behind, hold the bar on the back and ended up walking very quickly, as a result. The other grandson is a bit older (2 years), and this is his favorite riding toy -- he pushes it and rides it. I would buy these again in a heart beat.

How many balls would you say you need to fill a small kiddie pool?,descriptive,"First, find the volume of the pool.

Take the outside diameter of a ball, multiply it by 2 and then by pi. Then divide the pool volume number by the ball volume number. The answer will be a close guess of how many balls you will need.

How does Saturn look through this telescope? Can you see a lot of detail in the rings?,descriptive,"I've looked at Saturn through the XT10i using a 7mm Televue eyepiece (resulting in 180x magnification).  I think it's spectacular, but it depends a bit on your expectations.  The Cassini Division is clearly visible in the rings.It's important to note that the XT10i does not have a tracking capability, so at high magnifications Saturn will drift out of view quite quickly.  You don't really need the big aperture of the XT10i to see planets because most of them are very bright -  the XT10i excels at gathering light for viewing faint (deep space) objects. If planetary viewing is your main objective, a smaller and more portable telescope with a tracking capability may be a better choice.  If you're also interested in viewing galaxies, nebulae, etc, the XT10i is a fantastic choice.",NA,"[3, 3]",1

All that to say that there has been no rough play with it.  It looks absolutely brand new.  I've changed the batteries several times using different brands each time to no avail.  I contacted LeapFrog customer service twice and received an answer of ""change the batteries"" and ""our warranty only lasts 90 days"".  Needless to say, they were no help whatsoever.  I even asked for a wiring diagram so that I can try to pinpoint the problem myself, but they said one wasn't available.  They did send a 15% discount code as consolation.

4 Year old to old for it? Our daughter is 4 and we have the plastic kitchens. I keep saying i want to get rid of those and get a really nice one.

Daughter just turned 5 and got a ton of fake food for her birthday, and now is using a cardboard box to pretend its an oven!

It certainly is one of the tallest available in this price range and Iread some reviews that claim their 7-9 yr olds still play with it. It depends alot on the child's preference I""m sure and their interests, but if you have a 4 yr old now and one on the way, I certainly believe you would get your moneys worth out of it; as the baby will prob start playing with it around age 1 1/2 :)",NA,"[3, 3]",1

The gator has 2-seats, the tractor only 1. That's the main difference for us.

How can I be sure this is an authentic figure if it ships form china?  Wouldn't that indicate that's it's a fake?,descriptive,"Very unlikely. I bought mine when it was still being sold in the U.S. However, this is what I have heard--and have been able to put together myself:Most of these statues are made in China to begin with. That's just the way the world works. As such, sellers from China get their hands of them first before the 'official' retailers get them. I have seen this with countless figures, where a seller in China is offering the product before it's even out in the U.S. or other places. Currently I'm seeing it with a few Alter Strike Witches figures.Anyway, the reason I state that is because my friend--who follows this statue news and knows more about than I do--says that they are re-releasing Samus because she was so popular. This means that she's gone back into production, which means sellers in China will be getting them first again. If you are still worried,  you can wait for a few months for when she gets out to the rest of the world and then buy from a different seller. Also, check the feedback rating for the seller. If you see ANY negative feedback--or a lot of feedback that is 100% with little to no comments--odds are the seller can't be trusted in certain cases, but not always. In the end, it is up to you. However, it is likely that this is an official version of Samus. Mine was.",NA,"[2, 2]",1

So many companies are now operating out of their homeland and China's gotten a bad rap lately, but I think it matters more to consider who and how the company is run in China (or where ever)- I also try to look for those that have not had safety recalls or complaints.

We all thought that it was not working because we couldn't ""see"" anything but fuzz.  Grandpa was the only one that could take the time to look in the direction of something and then adjust the focus until something appeared.

How tall are these figures? (Nowhere in the description does it specify the height and width),descriptive,"Sorry for my 1st answer I'm trying to reply from my crappy cell phone but i meant to say frieza is 1.5 inches approximately anyway from shoulder to shoulder but slightly wider in the forearm region. Super saiyan goku is 6.5 inches from the tip of his hair to the bottom of his boots. i don't own non SS goku but the only thing that would change that 6.5 inch height would obviously be his hair. goku is 2 inches from shoulder to shoulder and again slightly wider near the forearms. now perfect cell is a taller character thus a taller figure standing 7 inches tall and just over 2 inches wide. vegeta is 6 inches and considering his hair height doesn't change it goes for SS and non SS forms which are 2 different figurines which is annoying but then again there is 3 different gokus and SS 2 is nowhere to be found so idk wut they r doin ovee at bandai cuz they shouldve included a SS2 interchangeable head with the SS goku. But hey I'm just a consumer with what they think is an endless supply of cash and can for over 100$ per figure. Anyway where were we... Trunks is 5.25 inches tall non SS and about 5.5 Super Saiyajin and he comes with a sweet sword! SS2 Gohan is 5 inches and so is SS1 form due to gohans weird SS1 transformation lookin hair with that top spike. and SS3 goku is just under 6.5 inches because his hair spikes but goes back which FYI makes him very top heavy and very difficult to pose without the included stand. I don't own krillin, SS Vegeta, non SS Goku, or Piccolo, YET but that's because people want insane amounts of cash for SS Vegeta and Piccolo. so there ya have it enjoy reading my novel of a response LOL hope it helped.

Hi!  What is the difference between this set and the other Lionel Penn Flyer O Gauge train set listed for about $264?Do U have a picture of the box?,descriptive,"This one, for $199, is this year's model.  The more expensive one is actually last year's.  More importantly, this one has a remote control that is pared to this specific locomotive.

The more expensive set does NOT allow you to do that.",NA,"[14, 14]",1
Hi!  What is the difference between this set and the other Lionel Penn Flyer O Gauge train set listed for about $264?Do U have a picture of the box?,descriptive,"The biggest difference between the 2012 and older sets versus this one is the new Lionchief remote control/power system AND the inclusion of RailSounds enabled sound effects in the locomotive versus the transformer control + basic air whistle effect in the tender of the 2012 & older models.  Lionel indicated they had managed to reduce their cost to produce the newer set while including the additional features on the electronics side (which is why it has a lower MSRP than the 2012 edition).  The new locomotive is die-cast like the 2012 model but does not have the separate chromed handrails (the newer model has them molded into the body of the locomotive, more durable) and has a 2-tone tender with a brown top unlike the 2012 model that was all one color.  The caboose in the 2013 set loses the illumination feature and is brown instead of red. The engine is not bright green as the photo might indicate, it's a dark gray with a dirty greenish tint with a change to straight gunmetal gray toward the front of the locomotive where the smokestack is located. I also noted a prior review here indicating this locomotive will not work on a ""conventional"" layout.  I have run a LionChief locomotive on a standard 18v layout with other trains and it works fine (as long as you use the LionChief remote to manage the loco it's paired with)... which is in line with what Lionel publishes on their site about the topic:Run more than one locomotive on the same track!* Distinct frequencies available for different LionChief locomotives allow for multiple remote engines to run at the same time* LionChief locomotives can also run on any track powered by a conventional transformer at a constant 18 volts* LionChief locomotives can operate at the same time as any Legacy or TMCC-controlled engine on the same 18 volt-powered layout and track.. the specific caveats on how this works are included in the user manual:""If you do choose to run your LionChief locomotive with a transformer, set the train voltage to full (18 volts) and use the remote to run the train and trigger the sounds. The locomotive is not designed to respond to the transformer's throttle, direction button, horn button, or bell button; the locomotive only responds to commands from its LionChief remote""",NA,"[9, 9]",1

How do you get the train cars to attach to each other? I attach them but they pull apart very easily. What am I doing wrong?,descriptive,"There are very helpful videos at lionel.com.

I recommend buying ""10 pairs JST Plug Connector RC Lipo Battery Male/Female"" and connecting the wires to these, so the battery can easily be replaced each time it begins to stop holding a charge. Also, if you strip the yellow cable and connect it with a female connection, you'll be able to charge the battery MUCH quicker then if you would the normal way. I'm talking 5-10 minutes instead of 30 minutes. The yellow cable will still work the same with knowing when to stop charging.

How is the battery? Is it a rechargeable or do I have to replace batteries?,descriptive,The LeapPad2 will run through batteries quicker than most toys.  This version of it does not come with the rechargeable battery pack.  The rechargeable battery pack is a seperate accessory and from reviews it does not last long.  What we found to be the easiest is to use rechargeable AA batteries when we are on the go and use the AC adapter (also a seperate accessory) for the house.  That way the batteries will last much longer.  You can find both the rechargeable battery pack and the AC adapter on amazon as well.,NA,"[3, 3]",1

"According to the product reviews, there seems to be some error; where 1 Pack was sent, instead of the Box of 36 Packs, has this been Fixed?",yesno,"As far as I know, it's fine.

Is the one player game fun enough to buy on that premise alone?,descriptive,"I'd say ""probably not"", unless you're a big fan of the show and would enjoy seeing all the references. I played solo a couple of times when I was learning the rules, but there are other games I own that work better for a single player.There's only one real solo scenario provided with the victory condition cards. You could play most of the others solo, but since they have no time limit other than ""do it before the other guy"", you'd never be at risk to actually lose. If you were highly motivated, it would probably be possible to write some additional solo scenarios for yourself.",NA,"[4, 5]",0

"How many players, minimum and maximum, to play?",descriptive,"4 maximum, 2 minimum.   I suppose you could play solo as well if you really wanted too.   It is enjoyable with 4 players, just be prepared to play for a few hours (3-4hrs on first play through).  I would say 2.5-3 hrs would be about a standard game when everyone has played before.",NA,"[3, 5]",0
"How much replayability am I likely to get out of Firefly, is there enough variability to keep games fresh for a long time?",yesno,"My friends and I have been playing it fairly regularly for a year or more now (has it really been long) and we are still enjoying it enormously. We put on the Firefly and Serenity soundtracks in the background while playing to help add to the atmosphere. The game expansions also add more complexity and player interaction so new elements add to the ""replayability"" as well. I found this game to be very worthy of the investment.",NA,"[2, 2]",1
"How much replayability am I likely to get out of Firefly, is there enough variability to keep games fresh for a long time?",yesno,"Absolutely! Not to mention, there some really creative folks out there that have created their own story cards (you'll understand when you buy the game). I've even made a couple of custom story cards myself, still working some of the kinks out, but they're pretty cool! Let me put it this way, you know how in Monopoly you do the same thing over and over? (buy land, build houses, build hotels, rinse, lather, repeat) Well, in Firefly, you may spend your first game getting up the money to buy your ship from Niska free and clear. The next time you play you may decide to rip off Admiral Harken right out from under his nose. There are several story cards and the expansions give you more cards to give you more playability. You'll very rarely do the same, exact thing in Firefly and like I said, people are also creating their own story/goal cards to continue the legacy of the 'Verse.",NA,"[3, 4]",0
When you complete a job does the job card go back to the discard pile or is it removed from the game (assume already have a Solid with that contact)?,descriptive,"It would be inconsistent for them to go into discards, IMO, because the first one gets kept with your ship card to denote that you're Solid, right?",NA,"[2, 2]",1
When you complete a job does the job card go back to the discard pile or is it removed from the game (assume already have a Solid with that contact)?,descriptive,"Firstly, people are mixing up ""Discard"" with ""Removed from game"".  If you do not take a mission (or buy an item) from a stack it goes into the ""Discard"" pile (and those cards are still ""in the game""), which other people can then look though and take cards from if at that contact.  If the mission is completed successfully it is ""Removed from the game"".  Obviously you can house rule stuff for varied impact on the game.",NA,"[2, 2]",1

I've heard this game turns into a racing game with little interaction when played with only 2 players. Is it fun with 2 despite this?,descriptive,"What? That's crazy talk.

Unless you don't want to, in which case, why are ya playin' together in the first place?",NA,"[1, 2]",0

They preferred another set we had that was plastic and hooked together and came with fun pieces that the marbles twirled through and pieces that made noise or lit up when the ball rolled through. The plastic ones could be built several feet high and in much more exciting ways. This one was hard to keep together since they all just balance on each other and you run out of combinations really quickly.

Can I use this for toddler transport in the sand at the beach? Radio Flyer Pathfinder Wagon Red,descriptive,"we just bought it and naturally, like every kind of stroller/wagon, it's rough pulling for the parent, but it's not terrible in the sand. we go to the beach with the wagon, not the stroller. it shakes off the sand by the time we get home ))",NA,"[3, 3]",1
Can I use this for toddler transport in the sand at the beach? Radio Flyer Pathfinder Wagon Red,descriptive,"You'll find mixed reviews online how this wagon performs in dry, loose sand at the beach. With the narrow tires, it bogs down and wants to plow especially if the front caster wheels aren't cooperating with the uneven surface. That's also when the caster spindles are most likely to get bent. 10""x 3.5"" pneumatic tires on rims can be purchased locally at many stores for $6.00-15.00 each and these are the same size used on Radio Flyer models with all-terrain tires. They have 5/8"" axle bores and can support 300 lbs. at 30 psi. The trick is modifying or replacing the factory 7/16"" dia. spindles to receive the larger 5/8"" bore wheels. You could consider securing them with cotter pins or hex nuts (if using a threaded rod). With larger tires, there are also slight clearance issues on the front caster spindles and wagon body at the rear wheels. With fab/weld capability and some technical savvy, you should be able to have a unique lightweight all-terrain transporter of small kids and equipment that proudly does the job between the beach parking lot and water's edge.

are these stars radioactive ?,yesno,"Yes, in a way; but NOT in a harmful way. All glow-in-the-dark products contain phosphors. A phosphor is a substance that radiates visible light after being energized - so, yes, they 'radiate', but radiate light, not harmful rays that we typically refer to as 'radioactive'. This effect is similar to what we have in, say, fluorescent lights, where ultraviolet light energizes the phosphor. Indeed, if one enlightens these stars with an ultraviolet source of light in a dark room, they will glow even better. IF, however, one would find these stars to glow all the time... such as, for example, hands on some of hand watches... then one could assume that phosphor is mixed with some small amount of radioactive material as in those watches. So, when dealing with stars, it may be better not to go with those that glow all the time.",Y,"[27, 27]",1

Can't decide to go for this or Bright Starts Clack and Slide Activity Ball .... suggestions? My baby is 6 months old.,descriptive,"We got the Winkel for our grandson when he was about 4 months old and he enjoyed it a lot for a few months. Now that he's 8 months, he only reaches for it when he wants something to gnaw on (great for teething!) but he doesn't really ""play"" with it anymore. His favorite early toy is still the Baby Einstein Take Along Tunes. He consistently goes right to this toy whenever he's on the floor or grabs for it on the changing table. He did like the Clack and Slide for awhile, but seems to be already outgrowing it now. Newest favorite toy is quickly becoming our iPads and iPhones. So I guess he's already a tech-a-holic type kid!

What size are the boards? Amazon sells a four pack of 5-3/4 x 5-3/4 inch boards for $7.62 so wondered if these are bigger  as only 2 for $6.59. Thanks,descriptive,"I apologize for posting info under the 2 Pack (which I do not own) but I can offer information for the four pack.  The four pack which I purchased has four separate 5-3/4 x 5-3/4 inch boards.  They are capable of being ""locked"" together (up to all four at once) to create a surface to place beads on that measures roughly 11-3/8 x 11-3/8 inches for larger projects.  If the four count package is what you were looking for and it's in your budget, I would suggest buying two packs of the four count so you can make a bigger surface.  We keep finding REALLY big awesome patterns online and can't make them without more space!  For small projects, these will work well.  I use these for a crafty kid's group.  One 5-3/4 x 5-3/4 per child.  Working in pairs doesn't work, because they need to get really close to the work surface and they have to crowd each other too much.  I have some cheaper ones that we use when we have more than four kids, but they don't lock together and they tend to warp when you fuse the beads.

Does this game replace Munchkin 1 (the original game) or can it be used with Munchkin 1?,descriptive,"Hi, according to my son, the cards are exactly the same as Munchkin 1 (original) the only bonus to this set is that you have a board to move your pieces on so you don't have to use other items to try to remember which level you are on.

what is the object...how do you play?,descriptive,"The object is to get your character to level 10, you start at level 1.  You gain a level by defeating monsters and by certain cards.  While doing this, you also try to prevent your opponents from getting to level 10.  Each turn you 'kick open the door'.  This may show a monster which you must fight or another card which you get to keep.  If you can not defeat the monster on your own, you may ask someone to help you.  Usually you'll have to bribe them with some of the monster's treasure; they drop treasure when defeated.  Your opponents can play cards to help the monster defeat you and you can play cards as well.  Total the points, highest number wins.  If you defeat the monster you go up a level and get the number of treasure cards listed.  Treasures include weapons, armor, spells, free levels, all kind of neat stuff.  It's a great game.  Munchkin Deluxe is even better because it includes a scoring board.  Not really needed but makes it easier.  We even use the board when we play Munchkin Cthulhu with all the expansions.  Hope this helps you.",NA,"[7, 7]",1

What is needed to fly?,descriptive,"You need a 6 channel transmitter at a minimum (spektrum dx6i). Although I would suggest buying a dx7s or dx8 to keep you good for the future. You also need a minimum 6 channel receiver which you can get bundled with your radio or purchase separately (spektrum ar6210). You also need batteries and a charger. You also need a 2650-3000 mah 6s lipo, and a charger. I would suggest searching for helifreak, runryder, or rcgroups at google. Search through those forums and most of you questions will be answered. If I were you I would skip this kit and buy the 500ESP or a 500DFC kit. Yes a bit more money but they fly so much better, although mine flew great stock. The big thing is that the newer Flybarless kits have less parts to break in a crash. Peruse through those forums I suggested and get educated. Good luck!

I'm doing a super Mario theme aquarium/ fish tank. Would the color and plastic hold up in a 55 gal tank?? It's fresh water not salt water.,descriptive,"Wow this is a really good question. So The paint is a bit thick on these however, you can scratch it off if you try. The problem here is , is this fresh water or salt water. Additionally what is the composition of the water, what if any chemicals are present in the water. You may also want to consider the safety of the fish. While these should be child safe ( no lead or PCB) the paint and or the plastic itself may break down over time and cause problems. I don't think the pressure in a 55 gallon tank would really be a factor. I know that is a long answer but there are may variables. Specifically how long will they hold up? Not will they hold up. Ultimate answer is no IMO. Eventually they will break down but my chemistry knowledge is limited. You may be able to pre-treat them with some form of safe plastic coating via a spray. 3M is now selling a product for cars that acts as a clear coat available at Walmart. Not sure if it is fish safe.

Is the O gauge better than the G gauge?,descriptive,"Hi, Christina!  You'll find the breakdown of train gauges at http://www.trainsetsonly.com/page/TSO/CTGY/Scales.  I grew up with O and S (Lionel) scale trains.  I find the smaller ones HO and (eek) N a LOT more difficult to work with but they take up less space.  The problem *I* have with the G-scale trains is that they are so large you need more room and accessories would take up that much more room as well.  I once set up an 8' x 8' train layout in a room 8'2"" x 8'4"" and had four different tracks set up along with all of the landscaping and the dreaded N as an 'amusement park' ride.  Because O is part of my family history I bought each of my Grandchildren their own set as an heirloom.  It's all a matter of personal preference which may be at least partly driven by space availability!  Thanks!",NA,"[2, 2]",1

"Will other cars fit in & work in this, such as matchbox size or is it strictly this brand only?",descriptive,"Some of the matchbox/hotwheels will work.  It all depends on the weight of the cars.

The Cars brand cars are a little bigger than the typical match box so it is usually not a problem with most of them.

"After a crash and  replacing one of the rotors it no longer properly hovers, it will lift off and stay in the forward direction but make circles?",descriptive,"This sounds like TBE, ""Toilet bowl effect"". It's when you are trying to hover but the heli moves in a circle, with the nose always pointing at the same wall. It can be caused by many things, but usually it's caused by friction or damage in the flybar linkage or flybar pivot. This causes the input from the flybar to the blades to be dampened or delayed. The easiest way to fix it is to take the flybar, links and blades off then re-install them making sure they move easily. If this doesn't work, then use a light oil, such as sewing machine oil, to lubricate the above parts and the bearings on the main shaft. Make sure to wipe all excess oil off so it doesn't attract dirt. One of these will usually fix it about 90% of the time. If that doesn't work check the parts for damage or signs of being bent.",NA,"[3, 3]",1
"After a crash and  replacing one of the rotors it no longer properly hovers, it will lift off and stay in the forward direction but make circles?",descriptive,You can try adjusting the trim.  But it's one of the harder problems to fix on the Micro-helis.You should also replace both rotors from a set. They are paired by weight and even a gram can cause wobble. Any knicks in the blade can also cause wobble.One more note: If it crashes in water the rotor lift arm motors might start twitching. It is then 'impossible' to sustain a reliable hover. You'll know if this is the cause if the heli is on and bound to the receiver but still moves the arms by itself. Happened to my first one.,NA,"[2, 3]",0

The factions are new spaces to put ships.  From the Game Salute (makers of the game) page  it looks like the 4th edition is just fancier.

"How does this game compare to DC Comics Deck Building Game? This one is $20 more, is it worth it?",descriptive,"I would say that both have their merits.  The Marvel deck building is a bit more complicated and has a more intense set up time due to the variety of cards and the way that you have to select which cards to place into a game, similar to Thunderstone but the game does not come with a way to organize it easily.  You generally have to pick the number of heroes based on number of players and there are a lot of different heroes.  Each hero has a 8-10 cards that are placed into the game.  Then you select the number and type of villains and henchmen based upon the number of players.  You do spend a bit of time looking for the correct cards.  A randomizer is helpful.  There are then different ""mission"" cards that you select to determine what kind of crazy plot the main villain is going to do over the course of the game.  It is also much more team based than the base DC game.  You need to defeat the final bad guy before you run out of cards or if one of the villains missions succeeds or everyone loses.  If you do win then it goes to finding out who won overall based on victory points.  Don't get me wrong it is a great game but much more complicated and takes a lot more time than the DC game.  For the money though I would get the DC comics deck building game if it is a decision between the two.  It is also a lot of fun with lots of replay ability and it is an easy set up to start gaming.  The starting game is everyone against everyone with the goal of collecting the most victory points so a little different than the Marvel one.  They do have an expansion set that changes it to a cooperative style similar to the Marvel game which is also fun.  The upside again is that it is a faster paced game and easier set up.  I have both the Marvel one with the apocalypse expansion and the the DC comics set 1, expansion, heroes unite and the just released Forever evil and I would say that I play the DC one alot more with my friends.  Also all the Dc comics ones are interchangeable so it has alot of inherent variety.  If you already have the DC game than I would definitely say the Marvel game is the next step in advancing your collection and exploring even more variety.  So yes worth the extra 20.",NA,"[2, 2]",1
"How does this game compare to DC Comics Deck Building Game? This one is $20 more, is it worth it?",descriptive,"I played DC's Heroes, and although it's fun it doesn't seem to have much in the way of a 'storyline' other then beating up on the DC Villians. I have to mention I've only played the starting game set and haven't had a chance to play any of the  expansion sets yet.  With Legendary you have multiple schemes, rather then just fighting the villain, that get you to race against him and try and beat the enemy before he wins. And each game I've played has seem to more like a comic book story that you're acting out on the game board.I hope this helps.",NA,"[2, 2]",1

Is this a newer version of the Undercover Mouse toy?  They look identical.,descriptive,"Yes, it's a new version, but like many newer versions, you're probably better off with the original. It's not identical; it's a lower-quality copy. This one uses C batteries, the original uses 3 AA batteries. We use rechargeables, which keeps the cost down considerably and which we use in a few other gadgets. This has one speed; the original has several speeds, although that might not matter to you (we use only the lowest speed). There also seem to be a lot of complaints about the quality of the new toy and its durability, and also the customer service of the ""As Seen on TV"" distributor that sells them. The original seems fairly well made and it's holding up intact after eight months of almost daily play, some of it pretty rough as the kitties dig into the fabric to ""lock down"" their ""prey"" hiding under the cover. It is starting to show some wear at the center where the fabric is fastened to the center mechanism, so I am looking for a spare. I think I will get the original version again, though. I saw the version made by Petlinks (Mystery Motion) and found it markedly ugly, in some kind of depressing muddy maroon color.

Anyone got a delay shipment notice from Amazon?,descriptive,"Yes, my expected delivery date was suppose to be feb. 19. When I asked the amazon rep why my order had not shipped yet as of feb. 18 I got concerned. Her excuse was that there were many who had preordered and that they did not have enough to fill the preorders. I said that doesn't make sense, I preordered mine back in nov of 2013, how could I not have one reserved already? The only solution they suggested was to cancel my order and order from one of the other seller on amazon and they would refund the difference in total price paid.  Which isn't a good option because if there were any issues with the item, I would have to deal with sending it back overseas and that would be more of a hassle in time and money. I'd much rather deal with amazon directly. What I think actually happened is their shipment has not arrived yet from their supplier whoever that may be and that's why our orders are delayed. They sent me an email that if they don't have the item by mar 21, they would cancel my order. If that happens, I will tell them to honor their first offer to refund the differnce I pay if order from another vendor. Because at that point I really wouldn't have any other choice.",NA,"[3, 3]",1

"How much ""video"" recording time do you get?",descriptive,"This depends on the size of the Micro SD card.

can you fly it outside?,yesno,"The Syma R/C Helicopter can fly outside but I noticed that under bright sunlight it seemed like it would lose signal to the remote control and fall from the air. It is a sturdy little thing though as that happened a number of times from 10 feet in the air and hit the driveway and it still works well. I thought it was the sun that caused the signal disruption because in the covered garage, it flew great with no signal disruptions. The wind can also make it drift a little because it's so light.

can you fly it outside?,yesno,"No, the RC works by Infrared, any sunlight will interfere with the signal and it will drop out of the sky like a rock.

can you fly it outside?,yesno,We haven't tried because its been snowy and windy.  Based on how it flies inside (once you get the hang of the controls) it would be easier to fly it outside.

does this have the capability to hover in place? I've purchased other helicopters like this and they only moved forward. Thanks,yesno,"Yes it does, but it will take some adjusting to the controls since there are light eddies and currents that constantly move within you house that can make it difficult to hover or to accurately control the craft because of it's small size being more sensitive to wind currents.  The nob controls the rotation of the craft while the left lever controls the forward and reverse pitch and the right lever controls the right or left pitch of the craft.  It charges in 1/2 hour and runs for about 5-7 minutes total flying time.  Typically we play a golf game landing from pad to pad around the house with 2 different helicopters (one at a time that way your always flying).  2 at the same time is fun but sometimes the controls switch to the other craft, which is mean but fun.  Dads usually end up playing with this more than the kids so fathers need to show restraint.",Y,"[5, 5]",1
does this have the capability to hover in place? I've purchased other helicopters like this and they only moved forward. Thanks,yesno,"Yes, it does.",Y,"[2, 2]",1
Is this hell suitable for young children?,descriptive,This helicopter is great for young children. It's easy to fly and will hover great and the throttle isn't spring loaded so you can set the speed and hover and it will stay there. Kids love to watch it and even take the controls. I had a 5 year old fly it. Plus it will take some hard hits without breaking.,NA,"[2, 2]",1
Is this hell suitable for young children?,descriptive,"Depends on the kid. I would say 8+ for independent play. We've had young cousins fly it. But after watching and learning from others. Young kids can definitely work it, it's just not an indestructible plastic kids toy. It needs to be taken care of, charged, not left on the floor, thrown into a toy bin, etc.",NA,"[2, 2]",1

"When playing with the CAH deck, can you easily tell who has the new Crabs cards or do they blend into your hand so they are not noticeable?",descriptive,"The cards are the exact same size, shape and texture as the official CAH deck. The back of the cards say ""Crabs..."" so, with a keen eye for detail, you would be able to spot them, but I cant think of a reason why that would be helpful in gameplay",NA,"[9, 9]",1
"When playing with the CAH deck, can you easily tell who has the new Crabs cards or do they blend into your hand so they are not noticeable?",descriptive,"The cards are cut and sized exactly the same as CAH's however the stock that Crabs uses is a different texture and gloss, and as others have stated they Read ""Crabs Adjust Humidity"". On the front of the card they will have a red logo indicating what set it's from, just as all the CAH sets have their mark for each set. It's not really a distraction, and if you're overly concerned with it then you're in far too serious mood for CAH anyway.",NA,"[9, 9]",1
"When playing with the CAH deck, can you easily tell who has the new Crabs cards or do they blend into your hand so they are not noticeable?",descriptive,The cards match the only difference is on the back it says crabs adjust humidity instead of cards against humanity and on the side with the   answer it has a small red crabs logo so yes they blend easily but they are different enough you can separate them of you want to.,NA,"[7, 8]",0

If you've never played either game (cards against humanity or crabs adjust humidity) does this game come w instructions2 tell us how2 play it?,yesno,"First off the game is mature audience only. I and crabs adjust humiditity both agree that if you are interested in trying out the game, then ur first investment will be to buy the cards against humanity starter pack.

This is the real item right?,descriptive,"Amazon is a pretty safe source for the Figuarts figures. I doubt they've even bootlegged the figure yet in China, since I haven't seen any bootlegs of Mars yet. Best way to tell, since you can't see the box on here, it to check it when you actually receive it. If the the little shiny TOEI sticker isn't on the box, reject it. It's a fake.

"It makes no sense, how do you play the game and what is it about?",descriptive,"There are 4 turtle tokens that you place on the board and the goal is to get them to their same colored gem. You start off with just the turtles and the gems on the board and gradually work up to using the obstacle tokens (ice blocks, walls, etc.), and you use the direction cards to move your turtle around the board. One card per turn. One card is to rotate the turtle, another to move it one space, etc. The first person to the gem wins. It teaches the basics of programming.",NA,"[2, 2]",1
"It makes no sense, how do you play the game and what is it about?",descriptive,"you start with all your cards, and the cards issue ""orders"" to the turtles.  The possible orders are: turn left, or turn right, move forward, shoot laser beam.  A player is supposed to issue all the orders he/she believes is required to reach the diamond (or can alternate turns).  So what the player is essentially doing is generating a sequential recipe to reach the diamond.",NA,"[2, 2]",1
"It makes no sense, how do you play the game and what is it about?",descriptive,"There isn't realy a winner because in the initial stages, as the child learns the moves, whoever goes first would win. The adult makes the game increasinly harder as the child learns the obstacles. Cards should be face up so child can choose moves, turn left, right or forward.The cards need to be laid out in sequence of the moves so the program could be followed by anybody else getting from start to finish. It's not a game of luck, it's logical thinking. As the child progresses, the jewels can be placed anywhere on the board. Better for 2 to play at that stage, as more obstacles can be placed in the way.",NA,"[2, 2]",1
"It makes no sense, how do you play the game and what is it about?",descriptive,"The turtles on the board need to get to the gemstones.The adult lays out the board, placing obstacles on it as he sees fit.In order to do that, the player needs to lay out his instructions for the turtle (move forward, left, right, shoot laser).There are varying degrees of difficulty that you can decide upon based no the progress and age of your kid.",NA,"[2, 2]",1
"Can children advance on their own, or do parents need to have a programming background to help them do that?",descriptive,No programming background is necessary. The concept is inspired by computer code. This game if probably most fun if an adult is involved. My son and I had fun making up our own games after playing by the rules several times.,NA,"[2, 2]",1
"My son is 4.5 but i have been playing more complex game like Tic to Ride, Forbidden Island, Jr. Catan..etc i wonder is this game will be suitable?",descriptive,"The game play for Robot Turtles is not complex, but is based on solving a ""programming"" challenge that an adult sets for the child.  As children learn how to create a path using the tiles, the difficulty can be increased, and different challenges can be created for different children playing at the same time.",NA,"[2, 2]",1
"My son is 4.5 but i have been playing more complex game like Tic to Ride, Forbidden Island, Jr. Catan..etc i wonder is this game will be suitable?",descriptive,I think it would certainly be appropriate.

I have a 6.5 year old daughter who enjoys this game very much and finds it challenging enough not to be boring.,NA,"[2, 2]",1
"My son is 4.5 but i have been playing more complex game like Tic to Ride, Forbidden Island, Jr. Catan..etc i wonder is this game will be suitable?",descriptive,"I'd say so. The game starts out pretty basic, but through the ""unlockables"" and advanced game modes there is a ton of room for increased complexity. I have a bright, game-playing, puzzle-doing 4 year old who loves Robot Turtles, and I'd estimate we've only tapped into about one quarter of what it offers.",NA,"[2, 2]",1
"My son is 4.5 but i have been playing more complex game like Tic to Ride, Forbidden Island, Jr. Catan..etc i wonder is this game will be suitable?",descriptive,Sounds like your son's critical thinking are great!  I would definitely challenge him with r.t.  Because this fame is different in that it is all about creating a sequence.  It is a different way of thinking and there is much to be gained from practicing it.,NA,"[2, 2]",1
"Will adults learn coding concepts from playing this game, or would it be silly for them?  Can one adult play this game alone as 2 players?",descriptive,"well, adults could learn from it, if they have no basic understanding of multi-step processes.. but no. it's really not aimed at adults or even teenagers.. it is definitely more for the under 10 set... and playing by yourself would just be silly.. as really each player is only playing against themselves anyway..",NA,"[3, 3]",1

Is this better than the rainbow loom?,descriptive,"This is a smaller loom that is held in your hand so that you can make different types of designs that come out the bottom without all the confusion. My husband; who has big hands, is enjoying how easy it is to use and prefect his skills...It is worth the money for sure. So to answer your question directly YES it is better, in my humble opinion.",NA,"[2, 2]",1
Is this better than the rainbow loom?,descriptive,"It depends on what you are going to use it for. All rainbow loom/rubber band bracelet designs can be made on the Rainbow Loom but this is not so for the monster tail. The Monster Tail is designed to make 8-peg creations (not necessarily limited to bracelets) either on the pegs or coming off of the pegs and towards the center, like single band creations where you put one band on at a time and then loom the bottom. Other designs can be made with multiple bands put on at a time. In short, the monster tail is made for making bracelets that don't use a peg-to-peg hooking process, so it is limited depending on what you plan to use it for, but you usually don't have to transfer the designs if you don't have another loom and you've used all of the pegs like the rainbow loom (although like I said technically anything can be made on the rainbow loom and more can be made on it than the monster tail).",NA,"[2, 2]",1
Is this better than the rainbow loom?,descriptive,"I would not say it is better, maybe easier. The way they have the slots angled on the outside of the post, makes it easier to flip your bands. I bought both for my grandchildren and the Monster Tail is easier for younger children.",NA,"[0, 1]",0
