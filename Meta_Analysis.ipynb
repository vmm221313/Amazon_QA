The lock itself is very well built and if it would have fit, I wouldn't have returned it.I bought this secifically for a new Beretta PX4 but because of the wide grip and magazine release button, I simply could not get this to fit well.  By turning the lock in all different directions, I finaly did get it locked but, just barely.  The lock will open up to about an inch and a half and it took almost all of that in order for it to just barely fit my handgun.  Problem was, with the lock open that much, it's total height was now about four inches.  There was no way this gun/lock combo was ever going to fit in a carrying case (I couldn't even come close to closing my case).I was disappointed but thought, no big deal, I'll just put it on my 10/22 rifle.

At $10 a pop, not a big deal to replace it, but thought getting it off would be a problem....so I grabbed an adjustable wrench and gripped the sliding unlock lever and forced it upward. It came up without much force, and the lock came off. So if anyone is not concerned with damaging the lock, it can easily be removed.So, this is really just added safety to keep kids from hurting themselves. Still, firearm safety training is your first line of defense, and guns should be locked in a secure safe, locker, closet, etc. Do not use this as a primary deterrent.Also, regarding revolvers, Depending on the model, I would not put a round under the hammer, or in the next position and expect this lock to prevent accidental fire.

When installed properly, Master trigger locks, whether key or combination, will with almost complete reliability do what they are supposed to do: prevent a child, visitor, family member, or intruder from picking up the gun and firing it, accidentally or on purpose. But BE CAREFUL, because people have managed to fire guns equipped with trigger locks. On some guns, the configuration of the trigger guard does not catch the little posts on the lock, and it\\'s possible to slide the lock and engage the trigger. The lock itself can fire the gun. The National Rifle Association discourages use of trigger locks, and there are better routes to gun safety.Why do you want to lock your guns? To prevent them from being stolen? To make it extremely difficult for someone who steals one to get it operating? To make it impossible for someone to pick it up and figure out how to fire it?If you want to prevent theft, then get a real gun safe. If it\\'s a large safe, nobody will drill or pry their way in, and it will be far too heavy to carry. If it\\'s a small safe, bolt it to your basement floor with masonry bolts into lead anchors. They won\\'t excavate your floor to steal a safe unless it contains a whole lot more than guns.If you want to lock your gun so that it\\'s practically useless to a thief, then get a serious padlock, probably with a long shackle, and lock it onto the frame so that either lock or gun practically has to be destroyed to get it off. For a revolver, open the cylinder and lock the frame. The cylinder cannot be closed, and the gun cannot fire. For a self-loader, remove the magazine, EJECT THE CARTRIDGE FROM THE CHAMBER, open and latch the slide, and lock the padlock up through the handle and out the top. (You might need a pretty long shackle on some guns.) You can also use a cable 3/8\" or even 1/2\" thick and a good padlock. Get a 5-foot cable and lock several guns at once. Some of the better bicycle locks work great. I use a 5-foot Schlage lock and cable in my car, and secure my 9-mm Beretta to the foundation of the passenger seat if I\\'m not going to carry the weapon. I also cover the gun with something so it\\'s not visible to the paroled murderers walking by. Not easy to get that gun, even if you steal the car.Yes, someone willing to dynamite your basement floor, haul away a 300-pound safe, spend hours opening up your safe with torches, and spend hours more filing away hardened steel shackles (or trying 3-digit combinations) will be able to steal your guns and use them in crimes. But they won\\'t. There are far easier ways to procure firearms.Note: If you do use a Master trigger lock, insert it so that the connecting bar is behind the trigger, if possible. If you do this, the trigger can\\'t be pulled, and the lock can\\'t be slid around so as to engage the trigger. In fact, a large enough padlock can be used as a trigger lock as long as the shackle can\\'t be maneuvered around the trigger or to a position in which the trigger has clearance to fire.Oh, and . . . I will give up my gun when they pry it from my cold dead fingers.'}, {'helpful': [0, 0], 'reviewText': \"The title says it all.

Follow the instructions to set up your own personal combination and away you go.Application: I have a variety of firearms and so far I have not found a trigger that can not be easily locked with this device.Use: the metal parts are well separated from the weapon by the use of rubber and plastic &#34;fingers&#34; so no damage comes to the weapon. Installation and removal is fast, although I have noticed a tendency for the combination wheels to only want to go one way. There are no exposed cables that can be cut and the lock is fairly sturdy, so removal by an unauthorized user would be difficult and likely damage the trigger in the process.Negatives: My only real complaint is that, as I have now gotten older, I find the numbers hard to read in low light.

More than tripled the width of my handgun when I secured itin the  best possible position.-Due to width, does not fit well in my stock cases at all.-not good for anti-theft.

This is really not the type of lock to prevent your gun from being stolen, but it will definitely reduce the risk of any accidental discharges. If you have young ones in the house, you may want to opt for a lock with a key as this one is pretty easy to get past.It is not for all guns, like I said, my AR does not agree with it. Part of this is due to my having a magazine well grip, but even without that I don't think this would be safe on that style of rifle.

You position the combo section on the trigger, fitting the nubs into the trigger guard so the lock is flat on the trigger guard. Then you slide the other section of the lock onto the shaft and squeeze the two sections together. IMO, the lock appears to be well made. I have tried to \"read\" the combination by slightly pressing the unlock button, but was not able to.Due to the design of the lock it does weigh ~half a pound and adds 4 inches width to your firearm when attached.
